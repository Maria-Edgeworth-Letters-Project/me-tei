               civil but really quite kind. Knowing that she is not exactly<lb/>
               the person one would have chosen for <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Sir Walters</persName> wife, people<lb/>
               in general pay her less attention than is due either to her<lb/>

            <p>
               When <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Sir Walter</persName> was asked how it had happened that<lb/>
               two such lions as he &amp; <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth</persName> had not met when<lb/>

               I for my part my mane had hardly begun to grow". This<lb/>
               was repeated by an intimate friend of his to whom he<lb/>
               said it. He has a wonderful freedom from all vanity he<lb/>
               <add>never</add> seems to be thinking that he is the great unknown. One almost<lb/>
               forgets who is speaking except from the brilliancy of what he says<lb/>

            <p> 
               I did not receive your letter till late yesterday evening<lb/>
               or I should have answerd it sooner. Perhaps often when the post has come in<lb/>
               you have said "Is there no letter for me? No letter from that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth</persName><lb/>
               She will never write to me! I was very foolish to write to her"<lb/>
               No, I hope this was not what you said or thought [ ] I hope that you<lb/>
               were more patient &amp; that you said She will write to me by &amp; by: I suppose<lb/>
               she has not received my letter" Maybe she lives a great way off<lb/>
               yes she does; do you know how far off? Take a map of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName> and<lb/>
               put it on the table before you, Now look for the county of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Longford_IE">Longford</placeName>. It<lb/>
               is just in the middle of the map, and now look in the midle of the<lb/>
               County. and there you will see printed in little letters <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Edgeworthstown_IE"><choice><orig>Edgworthtown</orig><reg>Edgeworthstown</reg></choice></placeName><lb/>
               and that is the place at which I live. You live at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Macclesfield_ENK">Macclesfield</placeName> as I<lb/>
               see by the date of your letter. I have just looked into the map of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName><lb/>

               and add them together you will find that they will make <add> 171

               even though you wait a few weeks for an answer, it is not agreeable<lb/>
               to be able to tell your thoughts to a person who is at 611 miles distance<lb/>
               I think it is; - for your letter gave me a <add>great</add> deal of pleasure and<lb/>
               I thank you for writing it too; - Your letter not only pleased me<lb/>
               but several of my brothers &amp; sisters and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">my father</persName> &amp; <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF2">mother</persName> &amp; aunts<lb/>   
               who were present when I read <add>out</add> it. I received it at supper time<lb/>

               I read it again at breakfast next morning to some of my brother<lb/>
               &amp; sisters who had been in bed at supper time, &amp; they liked it -<lb/>
               Your "good Mamma" told you very truley that you should<lb/>
               write letters as you would speak to the persons to whom you were<lb/>
               writing; you did so - &amp; therefore your letter was agreable; We all<lb/>
               think you are very fond of your Mother and that she is very kind to<lb/>
               you; - are we mistaken? and we think the brother who took the<lb/>
               trouble of copying your letter, is a very good brother - and that<lb/>
               you must be fond of him too, Are we mistaken? and we think<lb/>
               you are a happy little boy since you have a good mother &amp; a good<lb/>
               brother, and a good friend, Are we mistaken? -<lb/></p>

               that it is much more difficult to people to learn it after they<lb/>

               that is as much as ever I could grow (which is very little <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">my<lb/>

               as much as I cou'd to learn the latin grammar for I always wish'd<lb/>

               what your mother desires; but tho I said the verbs &amp; pronouns over<lb/>

               myself <unclear>remember</unclear> them better, yet I found it extreemly difficult to<lb/>

               of my brothers before it was printed he said suppose some Body will write<lb/>
               to you" Some body has, and I am glad that I inserted that note - because<lb/>
               it has been the cause of your writing to me. But I must explain the<lb/>
               meaning of that note to you; It was meant to <del>explain</del> ridicule those<lb/>
               who give long descriptions of wedding clothes &amp; fine coats &amp;c as if they thoug<add>ht</add><lb/>
               such things make people happy. When I was in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> about two years<lb/>
               ago I saw hanging up in a mantua makers room, some of the gowns of<lb/>
               a Lady who was to have forty wedding gowns &amp; the Mantua mak<unclear></unclear><lb/>
               told me that She had lain awake all night &amp; had puzzled herself<lb/>
               to invent different fashions &amp; trimmings for these gowns, one of which<lb/>
               cost 100 <del>gowns</del> <add>guineas</add>. Yet as I was informed by a sensible person the Lady to<lb/>
               whom all these fine things belonged was not likely to be very happy<lb/>
               for she was going to be married to a man who did not love her, &amp; who <choice><orig>mar<lb/>
                  ried</orig><reg>married</reg></choice> her only because she was rich. I do not know how many gowns <title ref="./Workography.xml#">Patty</title><lb/>
               and <title ref="./Workography.xml#">Fanny Franklin</title> had I believe they wore white gowns the day<lb/>
               they were married, but whether their husbands wore blue green, brown or red Coats<lb/>
               I cannot tell &amp; I do not think they cared. All I am certain is that they<lb/>
               were very clean, &amp; very likely to be happy because they were good &amp; loved<lb/>
               one another</p><lb/>
            <p>As to <title ref="./Workography.xml#">the old father</title> you know that his gray hair was comb'd very smooth<lb/>
               by his <del><unclear>father</unclear></del> daughter <title ref="./Workography.xml#">Patty</title> and that his cravat was perfectly clean &amp; white<lb/>
               I dare say that it was washed &amp; iron'd by his daughter <title ref="./Workography.xml#">Patty</title> who<lb/>
                  you know could wash &amp; iron so as to please even <title ref="./Workography.xml#">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Crump</title> -</p><lb/>
               <p>I have gone on writing as you did to me, as if I was talking, but<lb/><lb/>
               now I must stop for I have heard that <hi rend="underline">Women</hi> may talk too much<lb/>
               I had intended to send you a little play which I have just written<lb/>
               but it is fifty pages &amp; that is too much to copy, beside it will<lb/>
               be easier to you to read when it is printed; in the mean time<lb/>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">my father</persName> sends you a <add>little</add> book of <hi rend="underline">his</hi> writing you will see that it<lb/>

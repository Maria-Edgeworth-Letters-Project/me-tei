            <p> I have not received any
               letter from you short or<lb/> long since that which you received from me<lb/> in the

               <title ref="./Workography.xml#Ameri1">Sillimans Journal</title> - I told you that I
               had concieved<lb/> the books had been sent to me by either <persName ref="./Personography.xml#RalsG1">Mr. Ralstone</persName>
               <lb/> or the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickG1">
                  <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickA1">Ticknors</persName>
               </persName> till they assured me that they knew<lb/>
               nothing about the matter - &amp; I asked you in my last letter<lb/> to let me know
               distinctly whether I had commissioned<lb/> you to procure these <title ref="./Workography.xml#Ameri1">Sillimans Journal</title> for me or<lb/> whether
               you voluntarily sent them as a <hi rend="underline">present</hi> to me<lb/> And I
               besought you to answer this question candidly<lb/> that I might not unknowingly
               encroach upon your<lb/> kindness and liberality - I never ~~ that I can <choice>

                  <reg>recollect</reg>
               </choice>, ~ received an answer to this question - I took<lb/> the liberty of adding
               a list of the numbers of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Ameri1">Sillimans<lb/>
                  Journal</title> which are deficient in the bound &amp; unbound<lb/> volumes which
               I have received from you - I <add>will</add> send a<lb/> duplicate <add>list</add> of
               these deficient numbers <del>
                  <unclear>ordered</unclear>
               </del> in this letter<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> You say that you had intended sending me "several<lb/> of the last N<hi rend="superscript">os.</hi> of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Ameri1">Sillimans
                  Journal</title> but that my<lb/> last letter left you in doubt whether I was
               receiving<lb/> it from some other friend and you say you had<lb/> better wait till
               you hear from me again rather than<lb/> run the risque of burthening me with <hi rend="underline">duplicate</hi> No<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> From this observation I perceive that you<lb/> cannot have received my last letter
               in which I certainly<lb/> fully explained to you that I did not receive <title ref="./Workography.xml#Ameri1">
                  <hi rend="underline">Silliman's<lb/>
                  Journal</hi>

               that I was indebted to you for them till you informed<lb/>
               <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_Claremont_00583_1841_05_31_page02.jpg"/> me that you had sent
               them - I am really concerned<lb/> that my letter of thanks has never reached you
               as<lb/> you have reason to think me very negligent and<lb/> ungrateful for so much
               attention and kindness -<lb/>

            <p> You say in your last of April 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> - 41 that you

               You say Miss Hartley intends to honor me with a letter, I believe<lb/>
               if you have read my last [deletion]letter[/deletion] you know how much I wish it! but least<lb/>
               you should think me proud or capricious I will explain my reasons<lb/>
               and if they are wrong pray set them right - In the sentimental phrase<lb/>
               there was never any great Sympathy between us - I thought her a<lb/>
               very clever Girl but her heart appeared to me the least desirable part<lb/>
               about her, (if I am unjust let me again beg you to tell me so for I am<lb/>
               sure I should be very sorry to be so) - I had no reason to suppose that<lb/>
               she had any partiality for me, and I doubt whether if she had been<lb/>
               asked the same question she would have given the same answer you<lb/>
               gave Miss Van; an answer which flattering as it was I thought too<lb/>
               kind even to forget - In short I never could depend much on friends<lb/>

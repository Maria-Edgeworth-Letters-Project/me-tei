With truth my very dear Beaufort I assure you that I have
this day enjoyed a sweet species of pleasure from [unclear]hearing[/unclear] some who are near and dear to
You [unclear]under my roof- My beloved Wife and children are, Thank God, quite well [unclear][/unclear]We are
[unclear][/unclear] enjoying[unclear][/unclear] in this [unclear][/unclear] country - [unclear][/unclear]to this to
unclear][/unclear] the same for yourself & taken in as[unclear][/unclear]your[unclear]faithful & [/unclear][unclear][/unclear]
[underline]Aug[superscript]st[/superscript]. 17[superscript]h[/superscript]. 1820[/underline] --
	My dear Francis I write to you on your
friend Captain Hillyar's writing desk
in a delightfully pleasant room in
the house in which he resides at Yver
-dun [insertion]on the banks of the lake of Neufchatel.[/insertion] Hearing that we had arrived here
& that we were going to see Pestalozzi's
establishment he and M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Hillyar
went there to meet us. - You may guess
how glad we were to see the friend to
whom we know you are so much attach
ed & to hear the name of Beaufort so far
from home pronounced with so much
affection. He introduced your little God-
son to us - we heard him go through a
mathematical demonstration in his
class at Pestalozzi's clearly - he is a fine
stout looking boy with great power of
attention. - Capt[superscript]n[/superscript]. Hylliar & his gentle
obliging wife [unclear]invited[/unclear] not only myself
and your two neices, but all our party
here M[superscript]r[/superscript]. and M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Moilliet & their two
daughters - I frankly accepted the inten-
-tion for it was so cordially given I could
not bear to refuse it and to lose this only
opportunity of spending an hour or two
with your friend - He appears to me
one of the best and happiest tempered
men alive - enjoying every thing and
thanking God for whatever other people

might think a small comparitive portion
of what are called the blessings of life -
He has the first floor of an admirable
house & what do you think he pays for it
4 good bedrooms - 2 sittings rooms, & a good
kitchen with a servants room [deletion]& a good cellar[/deletion]
[deletion]to go to[/deletion] & a good garden to walk in all for
fifty pounds English a year. - The family
to whom the house belongs are most kind
to them, taking care of their children as far
as they wish it - and no more - and afford-
ing them every possible assistance & conve-
ience in the common affairs of life - For
instance an excellent cellar open to them on
the most reasonable terms - as Capt[superscript]n[/superscript]. H tells
"me he longs for Beaufort to know all these
"things and yet cannot bring himself to
"sit down to write such trifles to such a
"superior being" I determined to do it directly
- I have seen Capt[superscript]n[/superscript] Hillyar’s 4 children James [insertion]Beaufort[/insertion] 12 years old, Mary 5 –
Charles 3 and Henry 15 months old – fine healthy happy children
	Before I met or at least before I knew
who Capt[superscript]n[/superscript] Hillyar was, I had [insertion]just[/insertion] determined
to write to you about your brother William about
an establishment for the deaf and dumb
which I went to see here - I have not time
to write two letters; will you be so kind
to tell him that I have been much pleased
with what I have seen of M. Naef - whose pros-
-pectus I enclose - I went in to his house
quite unexpectedly and saw about 9 [deletion]dozen[/deletion]
of his pupils from 8 to 14 - their counte-
-nances shewed that they were kindly treated
- In eight months one of them a boy of eleven
years old has learned to speak [underline] intelligibly [/underline]
- I do not mean fluently - His voice, & the
voices of all whom I heard speak were less harsh
& disagreeable than any I ever heard from the

pupils of other masters who profess to teach the
deaf and dumb to speak [insertion]I may say more their voices are agreeable[/insertion] - [underline]They[/underline] read aloud quite
intelligibly - most of them are Germans - a
few French - no English - [deletion]and[/deletion] Mr Naef does
not understand English - But the same
methods by which he teaches one language
the pupil of course could learn any other!
- I saw [deletion]them[/deletion] [insertion]one[/insertion] cast up this sum with ease [deletion]in[/deletion]
4764 x 3460 x 2179 - he made 2 mistakes & corrected
them when pointed out -
The bedrooms are good - each child a sepa-
rate bed - large garden - & various means
of amusement and bodily exercise under
the head Gymnastics - If your brother
William should wish to send a boy here
(a girl is out of the question) M[superscript]r[/superscript]. and M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. HIl-
lyar would attend to him constantly
- They stay here [underline]another year[/underline] [insertion]for certain perhaps longer[/insertion]- If William
could send his boy to Paris I would
receive him & find means of forwarding
him to Geneva and from thence to Yver
-don - The expense in the whole - instruc
-tion boarding & lodging is 50 Guineas a
year - the food is good & sufficient as
the health of the boys shews - but it is
not luxurious - breakfast - soup - plain
meat & vegetables at dinner - The religion
in Yverdon is protestant & M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Naef is a
protestant - I shall be in Paris in the
2[superscript]d[/superscript]. or 3.[superscript]d[/superscript] week in October & can be heard of always
at the Delesserts - Rue Coqueron - At M.[superscript]r[/superscript]: Emer[unclear]y[/unclear]
Black bear Piccadilly there is a Swiss [unclear]voilure[/unclear]
who would bring any person from London
to Yverdun for twelve pounds - He offered
a gentleman here to bring him 7 boys for
[insertion]£[/insertion]10 each [insertion]in fourteen days[/insertion] - all expenses cleared - & he does not
starve them on the road - Now perhaps all
I have written may be quite useless but it will
shew that William B's interests are fresh in my mind

[unclear][/unclear] to Pestalozzi - he is almost past mental labors
-but others are carrying on his plans at his establish
ment - M.[superscript]r[/superscript] Schmidt [insertion]one of[/insertion] his pupils teaches mathe-
matics well - exceedingly well as far as we
can judge by the clearness & intelligence of his
his pupils - M.[superscript]r[/superscript] Greaves a gentleman who has been
here 2 years for no purpose but to learn the
system of teaching German & English - Of German
he knew nothing! - He teaches [insertion]language[/insertion] by shewing the exter
nal objects first & annexing the names at the moment
- then their qualities & then their actions
- He tries to make the children invent the rules of
grammar from shewing them their use - [unclear]The rev[superscript]d[/superscript]. M[superscript]r[/superscript]. [unclear]Muzo[/unclear]
from Oxford teaches Latin & Greek and English for Pestalozzi
on this plan - he is rather too full of words -
- I need say no more to You - there seems to be
a great inconvenience in the variety of the tongue
spoken at Pestalozzi's - The English is a [unclear]barbarous[/unclear]
jargon - The French bad - And the children and
their masters mix French English & German toge
-ther so that they will I fear speak none correctly
But what is worse their ideas seem confused in
this inaccuracy of language - Sum total - I would not
for any consideration that Francis or one of your boys
were at Pestalozzi's for their education - But I
should be glad that they would learn mathematics
from M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Schmidt - provided that they could not learn them as
well elsewhere - which is the thing to be proved - Fanny & Harriet are
well & happy - We have taken one delightful tour to Chamouni -
We are now taking another in the Swiss cantons - In 3 weeks time we
shall have finished this tour and shall
be again at Pregny on the banks of the lake
of Geneva with our kind friends M[superscript]r[/superscript]. & M[superscript]rs[/superscript]
Moilliet who are now accompanying
us in this excursion - Farewell
When you write or if you write send
through John Bidwell Esq[superscript]re[/superscript]. Foreign
Office & direct to me at M Delesserts Paris -
[underline]without[/underline] adding [underline]Rue Coqueron[/underline] as that I find
delays the delivery of letters 3 or 4 hours -

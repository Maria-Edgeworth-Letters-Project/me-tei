               On the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> - or 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of this month we shall<lb/>
               be very glad to see <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StriX2">Mr Strickland</persName> We<lb/>
               who remain at home for <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeL2">Lovell</persName> I am sorry<lb/>

               at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Trim_IE">Trim</placeName> where he has long engaged to be.<lb/>

               I foresee that you will put off your coming<lb/>

               the pleasure of saying come, to any of them<lb/>

               the Mission Street friends occupy two.<lb/>
               This day is so fine that all your little<lb/>

               I am not surprised that you are anxious to hear<lb/>

               serve the public by giving them a little chapter of<lb/>
               good sense in plain intelligible language<lb/>

               different pursuits from political squabbles.<lb/>
               But society after a certain period must I suppose<lb/>

               its own fermentation will at last work itself clear -<lb/>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Maria</persName> and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> tell me that nothing can<lb/>

               him. This has been a very favorable autumn<lb/>
               for the Gardens - and even Dahlias and Nasturtiums<lb/>
               were in high beauty till last<lb/>
               week when one nights frost<lb/>
               put an end to them at once - but the <unclear>overblown</unclear>
               <lb/>
               Roses on the trellis are in the most brilliant beauty<lb/>
               just now - quite as full of flowers as they<lb/>

            <p>
               I see by the last English paper that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StafR1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                  <unclear>Stafford</unclear>
                  <lb/>
               Cooke</persName> is tormenting the people of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Stafford_ENK">Stafford</placeName> by<lb/>
               claiming their houses as his property - and has<lb/>
               got all that have settled by the title's having<lb/>
               awarded to the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#JernG1">

            <p>
               I hope you have got a <unclear>groom</unclear> that gives you<lb/>
               satisfaction - Though our servant appears honest &amp; sober<lb/>
               &amp; careful we have been very unlucky in our horses lately<lb/>
               and have been without the use of one of them for<lb/>
               the last fortnight - but I hope he may not die.<lb/>
               I should thank you for very many excellent Birds far<lb/>

               better than those we get in our bogs &amp; Mountains<lb/>
               as they called. I was surprised to find in <unclear/> Brooks<lb/>
               <unclear/> that the feather's of the Ptarmigan - (a species of<lb/>
               Grouse) was one of the most valuable objects of traffic in<lb/>
               Lapland - Sixty thousand birds being shot in one<lb/>
               province annually! How are the numbers kept up?<lb/>
               My love to dear Cissy and Hal - &amp; Kate - The Celsia<lb/>

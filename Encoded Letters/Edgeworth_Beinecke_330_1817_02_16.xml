            <p> The Green Shawl has arrived quite<lb/>
                    safely, which is a miracle considering the<lb/>
                    manner in which it was packed, for the<lb/>
                    corners were quite split, and the green <unclear>shawl</unclear>
               <lb/>
                    very apparent, &amp; had not the custom house<lb/>
                    officers been blind, they would have seized<lb/>
                    both it and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Captain Beaufort</persName> too - it is<lb/>
                    much approved of &amp; thought very cheap<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But now as to my own Crimson affair<lb/>
                    I have heard no tidings whatever of it, the<lb/>
                     Post Master General of <placeName ref=".'Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName> has been<lb/>
                    applied to about it, and he has done every<lb/>
                    thing that he could <del/>, but has not heard<lb/>
                    anything, he has written to the English Post<lb/>
                    Master <del/>, but I do believe that <add>it</add> was lost,<lb/>

                    either going from the Ordnance Office or in it - <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Now will you be so kind as to inform me by<lb/>
                     whom it was sent and to whom it was deliverd<lb/>
                     And how it was packed, was it put between<lb/>
                    two pieces of pasteboard, or was it packed<lb/>
                    according to your way, merely in paper? I assure<lb/>
                    you I am not angry at the packing of the<lb/>
                    Green Shawl, I only tell you to warn you<lb/>
                    against any future accident - I must beg<lb/>
                    of you to confess that I have the patience<lb/>
                    of Job about the Crimson Shawl -<lb/>
                    I send you a draught on Hoare &amp; Co <unclear>for</unclear>
               <lb/>
                    the price of my Green [<unclear>frisch</unclear>frisch -<lb/>

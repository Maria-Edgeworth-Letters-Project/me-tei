generations - I heard much of "<hi rend="underline">Young <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName></hi>"
when I was in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> - I do not know
how to explain or define to you what is
meant by young <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName> - M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Milne a
young <hi rend="underline">fashionable</hi> <unclear>&amp;</unclear> poet in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> - a diner
out And a speaker in parliament who has
obtained <add>early</add> celebrity or at least notoriety in all
these lines of life is at the head or thinks
himself at the head of Young <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName> -
They profess to be moral, religious, honorable
and chivalrous - not to be <hi rend="underline">utilitarians</hi> (those
are their particular detastation - Not to be
high Churchmen - quite - but to support
Church &amp; State - not to be P<unclear></unclear> ites -
- quite - but to be liberal &amp; not too liberal
to <unclear>P</unclear> liberal to Catholics also - but
<unclear></unclear> to Catholics
<hi rend="underline">If</hi> they could keep their enthusiasm &amp;
conduct up to the high tone of morality
they profess and if they could stand steady
on the broad stone of honor without
antics or bravadoing &amp; <hi rend="underline">if</hi> they could keep
clear of party spirit, affectation &amp; <hi rend="underline">puppyism</hi>
they would do a wonderful deal of good
&amp; would deserve the highest honors
of their country - But here are many
ifs, and difficulties which not one
<unclear></unclear> said of "Young <hi rend="underline"><placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName> - it is</hi>" ever
thought of when they adopted the apella-
-tion and above all), - the dress -.
How would you Young <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName> know <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName>

Why by his open breast or open shirt collar
<del><unclear></unclear></del>
-collar to this says in truth he must have none - but
<del><unclear></unclear></del>
his shirt must turn down at the neck which school boys
or I am told, in imitation of the ancient
<hi rend="underline">Romans</hi> (who had no shirts) - If the gentle
man does not chuse to bare his neck and
shews himself like Lord Byrons picture
if he will wear a neck kerchief cravat or

by whatever name it should be called it must
be <hi rend="underline">white</hi> - "Down with Black Collars" as it was
cried by the <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Paris_FR">Paris</placeName> mob to your Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>. Turnbull

tore off his coat &amp; burned it rather than

Young <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName> is to be known by his long
hair streaming over his face and shoulders
- curled or uncurled - Black Brown or Red
so it must be worn - natural or false so
it must be or you cannot be a young <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName>
- much of their strength is in their hair -
	But I am writing upon them much
more of my paper than I can afford
	I am sorry to hear of burglaries in
your city - In spite of your intellectual
improvements - How is this? Does moral
conduct not follow from intellectual cultivation
	The subject <unclear></unclear> question interests me
much - The object of the tale I am now
writing or thinking of writing is to shew
that those who attempt to improve the
education and condition of the <hi rend="underline">poor</hi>
(<unclear></unclear> we <hi rend="underline">have</hi> poor in our country)
or of the lower classes in any country
must take special care that the moral
education keeps pace with the intellectual
else they do more good than harm to society
and do not increase the real happiness of
the individuals - my heroine is to be raised
from Town life - and the <hi rend="underline">benevolent</hi> lady
<del><unclear></unclear></del> gives her all manner of
accomplishments but forgets principles
and does not prepare her temper for the
trials she must meet with in her sudden
rise in life - nor does she <del></del> teach
her the self-control whicn in her motherless
state is peculiarly necessary to enable her
to resist the temptations to which a young
beauty parvenue is exposed -
As far as concerns my heroine <add>&amp; her patroness</add> only you
cannot except for my sake my dear Sir be
much interested in all this - But perhaps your
daughter <add>or Mrs Sprague</add> may &amp; may have heard of facts and

examples that would be useful to me to know
-	I mean in the course of the story (if I can to
shew that unless great precautions are taken
in the preparation of the individual raised
<hi rend="underline">per saltem</hi> in life, there is a bad chance of
the rise in condition being for their happiness
	I shall touch upon the cure that ought
to be taken by patrons &amp; patronesses of charita
ble schools both to keep the moral ed.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> equal
to the intellectual and also to make the
motives for industry and for the acquirement
of knowledge, pure and good - not connected
with envy as emulation is to apt to be
- and not <add>merely</add> springing from <hi rend="underline">avarice</hi> or <hi rend="underline">worldly</hi>
<hi rend="underline">ambition</hi> - Those motives are subject to
great disappointments &amp; to lead at all
times to heart burnings if nothing worse
and to unhappiness within if not in out-
ward circumstances or appearances.
<del>My <unclear></unclear></del> I was called away
as I was writing this to go to see a show
on the Green at the end of the village -
a show of Elephant &amp; horses and horseman
ship - and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. E whom you know, and
another M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. E whom you dont know, my
brother Francis's wife, a Spanish lady <del>who not</del>
who has now five children who form the
whole family at Edgeworths town <add>&amp; all</add> went to
see the show - The children all have the hooping
cough but the entertainment <del><unclear></unclear></del> operated
so powerfully that they never once hooped during
the hour we were there - I was never better
entertained tho I have seen <add>fine</add> exhibitions of
horsemanship in Dublin &amp; <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> - I was
surprised to see in the first place the size &amp;
magnificence of the Tent - One hundred &amp; forty
feet circumference! Seats all round the
circus raised four rows &amp; covered with painted
cloth like carpets We saw <del>two</del> <add>a</add> most graceful
and active youth ride two horses abreast -
one foot on one the other foot on the other
horse round &amp; round the center pole of the
tent - then four in hand - Then two young
men full canter <del><unclear></unclear></del> - One standing on the
others shoulder! &amp; waiving hands &amp; arms
	A large village audience had assembled and
among those <add>of the upper class</add>were the protestant clergyman &amp;

clergyman &amp; his sister who went with us - and the Catholic
priest - I was very glad to see them both sitting on the
same bench and enjoying &amp; sanctioning these innocent
diversions - Several pretty young girls were there
and I am sure enjoyed as much real pleasure
as if they had been finely dressed and raised
from their <del>rank</del> humble stations to be young
ladies in high life &amp; sitting at a grand
theatre in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> - perhaps envious or jealous
of the dress or beauty or high birth of somebody
opposite to them or in the same box -
	The elephant was as good at Edgeworths town as in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName>
and ran his rational recreations over as well as
if he were exhibiting at the Tower or the
Zoological Gardens -
	And now my dear D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Sprague I
think you will say I have written enough and
very glad shall I be if you think that I have made
up for long silence &amp; ingratitude</p>

<p>I continue to find Sillimans journal a most interesting
book - Doctor Robinson professor of astronomy and
Astronomer Royal, Armagh and one of our first men of science and of
genius much admires this American Journal &amp;
I have the pleasure of lending it to him - He is married
to my sister Lucy - married her last year - a marriage
in which all her family rejoiced - she had been for years
in bad health confined by a spine complaint - which
she bore with exemplary fortitude &amp; sweet patience
- She is now in the <unclear>enjoyment</unclear> of as perfect happiness
and health as can be -
	I have said nothing of the books we
have been reading - I should have told you that we have been reading
Prescott Conquest of Mexico - the most interesting book
I have seen this century - I am now hearing it read for the

on my return home found my brother is reading it <add>&amp; I Sharing it</add> over again with
the greatest delight</p>

                <p>Edgeworths Town
Aug[superscript]s[/superscript]. 16th 1844
My dear Doctor Sprague -
You have reason to think me the most
ungrateful of beings - Yet from your
benevolent indulgence I feel assured
that you do not condemn me utterly
unheard - I received your last kind
letter dated Nov[superscript]r[/superscript]. 1[superscript]st[/superscript] first 43 many
months ago - but I did not receive
the books [unclear]Turnbulls[/unclear] life and the [unclear]N[superscript]os[/superscript].[/unclear]
of the Journal of Science for some time
afterwards - I was in London with
my sister Mrs. Lestock Wilson; staying
the winter and spring of the ensuing
year with her and being in a whirl-
-wind or a whirlpool all the time I
was in Town I absolutely had not
an hour or half an hour in which
I could write a rational letter - The
answers to notes of invitation and
letters home and visit and the necessity
of eating drinking and sleeping absolutely
took up every moment - Then I was
travelling to various places in the country
in England and I did not reach home
till May (5[superscript]th[/superscript]) I found your books and
[deletion][unclear][/unclear] and[/deletion] was going to write to you
when I was taken ill - with Eresipelas
	I forgot to tell you that I had a very

serious illness the year before as the
newspaper truly informed you -
[deletion]But[/deletion] The Eresipelas [insertion]which I had in May last[/insertion] though not so dan-
gerous as the previous attack [insertion]in 43[/insertion] was
alarming enough my pulse being above
100 [deletion]considerably[/deletion] - Providentially however
by good nursing and care & skill of a
good physician (Sir Henry Marsh of Dublin
I [deletion]was[/deletion] recovered - One of my sisters [insertion]nursed me[/insertion] One
who never had the pleasure of your
acquaintance & whose name Harriet
Butler wife of the Rev[superscript]d[/superscript] Richard Butler
of Trim may perhaps never have reached
you - The most amiable and the
most highly informed among our
sex are often those whose names are
unknown to fame.
	But instead of writing you this
eulogy on my dear sister Harriet I
had better finish my own exculpation
I have only to add that I was [deletion]so[/deletion] long
after this illness forbidden the use
of my pen and I am but just now
permitted the free use of it - free use
I can hardly yet say - for I am often called
upon before I have been half an hour
with pen in hand called upon by my
guardian angels desiring me to lay
it down and not to tire myself to [underline]death[/underline]
- My friends are really too careful of
me - but I am not killed with kindness

I am only vexed that I cannot write to
thank my absent and distant friends
for favors - I have never [insertion]since my illness[/insertion] written one
line yet of what I had begun to write
before - I have written only letters and
scarcely any letters except to my own family
or the particular friends in London
who were urgent for replies to their
inquiries about my health -
`Joanna Baillie and M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Marcet for
instance and Dr. Hollands wife
Sidney Smith's daughter
	Must I name Sidney Smith to an
American? Yes surely as you are not
one of the Repudiators you probably
are not offended by the truth or by
the wit and humor of his remarks
	I saw something of him [deletion]and[/deletion] [underline]behind[/underline]
the scenes, as I may say, during my visit
to London - I saw him at his daughters
quite at his ease - not playing Wit
and then he was peculiarly agreeable
I think him a very amiable affection
ate and truly benevolent man
And at his own residence, [insertion][unclear]Coomb Flowry[/unclear][/insertion] & in his own
parish he is I am assured quite adored
	And the person who last told me so
was one worthy of credit and one able
to judge herself a most amiable woman
Lady Bell - widow of the celebrated Sir
Charles Bell the Surgeon - [insertion]whose man[superscript][unclear][/unclear][/superscript] are just re-
[unclear]embarked[/unclear] by her

	I think you are too severe upon
(Col[superscript]l[/superscript] Turnbulls Memoirs - M.[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Edgeworth and
I have found many parts of them very

interesting - all those parts of his personal
narratives in London & Paris, and
every where when he describes dramatic
ally and from the life truly and exactly
what he saw and heard of the various
characters he met with - especially in
revolutionary France - [deletion]The[/deletion] [unclear]facts[/unclear] are always
interesting to human creatures & as part
of the history of human nature Facts that
illustrate the characters of celebrated indiv
-duals are always valuable & valued
	Even the most trivial words and actions
for instance of such persons as Talleyrand
Madame de Staël [unclear]Duvret[/unclear] &c - [insertion][unclear]long[/unclear][/insertion] posterity will
read with curiosity [unclear]while[/unclear] all the long letters
and pious justifi[unclear][/unclear] touching only by gone
politics or private intrigues of diplomatists are
useless & tiresome and the [unclear]exercise[/unclear] of the books there
remain [unclear]unread even[/unclear] by the present generation &
may [deletion]prevent[/deletion] by the size & weight how much they
Twill the volume prevent its going to posterity
- The beautiful sketches with which the book
is ornamented will do much however to preserve
it in the houses and libraries of every person of any
taste for the Arts -
Thank you my dear Sir for sending me the
Book which has amused me more than I
could have expected when first I saw its bulk
& [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] felt its weight - Your American books
are in general heavier than ours of the same sizes
probably from the paper being the [unclear][/unclear] - you print
beautifully when you chuse so to do - And most
shabbily & on vile paper when are only looking to
cheapness & supplying the [unclear]amusement[/unclear] of the day & hours
	I have An American copy of Helen which is on
the worst paper conceivable & squeezed into the smallest
compass and [unclear]worst[/unclear] type - But still I am thankful
that the Americans republished it at all -
	You ask me about a forthcoming novel
There is no [underline]Forthcoming[/underline] Novel by Maria E - I am writing a tale
[insertion]but I have been so interrupted by illness - London - &c &c &c
[unclear] I know not[/unclear] whether it will ever be finished -[/insertion]
[underline]of which[/underline] you say the newspaper assure - I believe
that paragraph must have been put in to newspaper
by Bentley who has just [underline]re[/underline]published in one volume
my father's memoirs which I have cut down to
one volume, by taking out all that I thought su-
perfluous in the volume which [underline]I[/underline] wrote - I have not
touched my fathers part - Exactly upon the principle
which I suggested w[superscript]d[/superscript] be advantageous to Col[superscript]l[/superscript] Turnbull

Memoirs, I left in my fathers all that was person
al narrative and which I felt was interesting
and had been assured the public [unclear]so found[/unclear] -
	Bentley was not anxious to publish my abridg-
ment of these Memoirs fearing there would not be
demand for them at the present day - and
he made an effort to engage me to promise
him "[underline]a for[/underline]thcoming novel" were his very words
which he understood he said I was writing
	I told him that I had no novel ready to
come out and that I never bargained for any
work till it was completed - and that I would
not enter into any engagement for what I am
writing or bind myself in any way to finish
it or to give it to him - But that when finished
I would give him the first offer of the book or
that if I die & consent to be published my execu
tor should give him the first offer - I have
[underline]bored[/underline] you with this long story because you
have persuaded me that you are so much
interested for me and [insertion]all[/insertion] my doings, and [unclear]works[/unclear]
that I felt irresistibly tempted to bore you
through and through -
	I send you a huge packet of auto
graphs which I hope will cost you nothing
else they will cost you more than they
are worth - At your suggestion I have sent
you some papers (de trop) of the story which
I am now writing and while I had [unclear][/unclear]
- I have now cut the pages into slips for
your convenience of giving away to your
autograph lovers - and I have written my
name and the date of the year at the bottom
of each for I was anxious to do whatever you
wish in this small matter - the only opportu
nity I have [deletion]for[/deletion] of shewing my sense of your
continued attentions and really valuable
gifts to me [insertion](and among the most valuable I count y[superscript]r[/superscript]
time in writing to me - You who have
so much of correspondence to do for so many[/insertion]
Your account of the Associations of Young
Men for mutual improvement is highly
creditable to your part of the country and
will no doubt operate happily upon [insertion]literary[/insertion] society
and on moral conduct in the succeeding


6
generations - I heard much of "[underline]Young England[/underline]"
when I was in London - I do not know
how to explain or define to you what is
meant by young England - M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Milne a
young [underline]fashionable[/underline] [unclear]&[/unclear] poet in London - a diner
out And a speaker in parliament who has
obtained [insertion]early[/insertion] celebrity or at least notoriety in all
these lines of life is at the head or thinks
himself at the head of Young England -
They profess to be moral, religious, honorable
and chivalrous - not to be [underline]utilitarians[/underline] (those
are their particular detastation - Not to be
high Churchmen - quite - but to support
Church & State - not to be P[unclear][/unclear] ites -
- quite - but to be liberal & not too liberal
to [unclear]P[/unclear] liberal to Catholics also - but
[unclear][/unclear] to Catholics
[underline]If[/underline] they could keep their enthusiasm &
conduct up to the high tone of morality
they profess and if they could stand steady
on the broad stone of honor without
antics or bravadoing & [underline]if[/underline] they could keep
clear of party spirit, affectation & [underline]puppyism[/underline]
they would do a wonderful deal of good
& would deserve the highest honors
of their country - But here are many
ifs, and difficulties which not one
[unclear][/unclear] said of "Young [underline]England - it is[/underline]" ever
thought of when they adopted the apella-
-tion and above all), - the dress -.
How would you Young England know England
[deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion]
Why by his open breast or open shirt collar
[deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion]
-collar to this says in truth he must have none - but
[deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion]
his shirt must turn down at the neck which school boys
or I am told, in imitation of the ancient
[underline]Romans[/underline] (who had no shirts) - If the gentle
man does not chuse to bare his neck and
shews himself like Lord Byrons picture
if he will wear a neck kerchief cravat or

7
by whatever name it should be called it must
be [underline]white[/underline] - "Down with Black Collars" as it was
cried by the Paris mob to your Col[superscript]l[/superscript]. Turnbull
in 97 - when he ran from them & wisely
tore off his coat & burned it rather than
be mobbed - [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion]
Benites the white neck cloth or bare neck
Young England is to be known by his long
hair streaming over his face and shoulders
- curled or uncurled - Black Brown or Red
so it must be worn - natural or false so
it must be or you cannot be a young England
- much of their strength is in their hair -
	But I am writing upon them much
more of my paper than I can afford
	I am sorry to hear of burglaries in
your city - In spite of your intellectual
improvements - How is this? Does moral
conduct not follow from intellectual cultivation
	The subject [unclear][/unclear] question interests me
much - The object of the tale I am now
writing or thinking of writing is to shew
that those who attempt to improve the
education and condition of the [underline]poor[/underline]
([unclear][/unclear] we [underline]have[/underline] poor in our country)
or of the lower classes in any country
must take special care that the moral
education keeps pace with the intellectual
else they do more good than harm to society
and do not increase the real happiness of
the individuals - my heroine is to be raised
from Town life - and the [underline]benevolent[/underline] lady
[deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] gives her all manner of
accomplishments but forgets principles
and does not prepare her temper for the
trials she must meet with in her sudden
rise in life - nor does she [deletion][/deletion] teach
her the self-control whicn in her motherless
state is peculiarly necessary to enable her
to resist the temptations to which a young
beauty parvenue is exposed -
As far as concerns my heroine [insertion]& her patroness[/insertion] only you
cannot except for my sake my dear Sir be
much interested in all this - But perhaps your
daughter [insertion]or Mrs Sprague[/insertion] may & may have heard of facts and

8
examples that would be useful to me to know
-	I mean in the course of the story (if I can to
shew that unless great precautions are taken
in the preparation of the individual raised
[underline]per saltem[/underline] in life, there is a bad chance of
the rise in condition being for their happiness
	I shall touch upon the cure that ought
to be taken by patrons & patronesses of charita
ble schools both to keep the moral ed.[superscript]n[/superscript] equal
to the intellectual and also to make the
motives for industry and for the acquirement
of knowledge, pure and good - not connected
with envy as emulation is to apt to be
- and not [insertion]merely[/insertion] springing from [underline]avarice[/underline] or [underline]worldly[/underline]
[underline]ambition[/underline] - Those motives are subject to
great disappointments & to lead at all
times to heart burnings if nothing worse
and to unhappiness within if not in out-
ward circumstances or appearances.
[deletion]My [unclear][/unclear][/deletion] I was called away
as I was writing this to go to see a show
on the Green at the end of the village -
a show of Elephant & horses and horseman
ship - and M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. E whom you know, and
another M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. E whom you dont know, my
brother Francis's wife, a Spanish lady [deletion]who not[/deletion]
who has now five children who form the
whole family at Edgeworths town [insertion]& all[/insertion] went to
see the show - The children all have the hooping
cough but the entertainment [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] operated
so powerfully that they never once hooped during
the hour we were there - I was never better
entertained tho I have seen [insertion]fine[/insertion] exhibitions of
horsemanship in Dublin & London - I was
surprised to see in the first place the size &
magnificence of the Tent - One hundred & forty
feet circumference! Seats all round the
circus raised four rows & covered with painted
cloth like carpets We saw [deletion]two[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] most graceful
and active youth ride two horses abreast -
one foot on one the other foot on the other
horse round & round the center pole of the
tent - then four in hand - Then two young
men full canter [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] - One standing on the
others shoulder! & waiving hands & arms
	A large village audience had assembled and
among those [insertion]of the upper class[/insertion]were the protestant clergyman &

clergyman & his sister who went with us - and the Catholic
priest - I was very glad to see them both sitting on the
same bench and enjoying & sanctioning these innocent
diversions - Several pretty young girls were there
and I am sure enjoyed as much real pleasure
as if they had been finely dressed and raised
from their [deletion]rank[/deletion] humble stations to be young
ladies in high life & sitting at a grand
theatre in London - perhaps envious or jealous
of the dress or beauty or high birth of somebody
opposite to them or in the same box -
	The elephant was as good at Edgeworths town as in London
and ran his rational recreations over as well as
if he were exhibiting at the Tower or the
Zoological Gardens -
	And now my dear D[superscript]r[/superscript]. Sprague I
think you will say I have written enough and
very glad shall I be if you think that I have made
up for long silence & ingratitude
	I really am your grateful and much obliged
Maria Edgeworth
I continue to find Sillimans journal a most interesting
book - Doctor Robinson professor of astronomy and
Astronomer Royal, Armagh and one of our first men of science and of
genius much admires this American Journal &
I have the pleasure of lending it to him - He is married
to my sister Lucy - married her last year - a marriage
in which all her family rejoiced - she had been for years
in bad health confined by a spine complaint - which
she bore with exemplary fortitude & sweet patience
- She is now in the [unclear]enjoyment[/unclear] of as perfect happiness
and health as can be -
	I have said nothing of the books we
have been reading - I should have told you that we have been reading
Prescott Conquest of Mexico - the most interesting book
I have seen this century - I am now hearing it read for the
second time - I read it during my convalescence & immediately
on my return home found my brother is reading it [insertion]& I Sharing it[/insertion] over again with
the greatest delight

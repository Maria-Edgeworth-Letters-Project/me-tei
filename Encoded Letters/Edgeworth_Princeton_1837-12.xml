                  My dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ElioC1">Mrs. Norton,</persName>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               I have now before me<lb/>
               a most kind and delightful letter of yours<lb/>
               dated October 16, <hi rend="underline">1836</hi>!!<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I am shocked at the thought of its<lb/>
               having remained above a year unanswered<lb/>
               unacknowledge - How ungrateful you have<lb/>
               had cause to think me and how wanting<lb/>
               not only in good feeling but in common good<lb/>
               manners. Believe me my dear Madame<lb/>
               that I am not to blame though appearances<lb/>
               are so much against me. The fact is that<lb/>
               both your letter and dear Louisa's remained<lb/>
               in one of the books which <persName ref="./Personography.xml#NortA1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Norton</persName> sent to<lb/>
               <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> for me. The books have remained in<lb/>
               <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> ever since and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF1">my brother <add>Francis</add>
               </persName> who lately<lb/>
               opened one of the volumes there found the<lb/>
               two letters and sent them by post to me -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>- I have but just received them and I hasten<lb/>
               to thank you with all my heart. Your letter<lb/>
               not only flattered me in the highest degree<lb/>
               <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_Princeton_1837-12_page02.jpg"/>

               by your approbation of my writings but<lb/>
               delighted my heart with the idea that<lb/>
               they had been of use and pleasure to you<lb/>
               and to your family, and that they had called<lb/>
               in your affectionate mind such benevolent<lb/>
               partiality for me - I feel very much obliged<lb/>
               to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickA1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Ticknor</persName> for having kept alive these<lb/>
               kind dispositions by her account of her <choice>

               </choice> to our home, I wish you could come and<lb/>
               judge for yourself - I feel almost sure that there<lb/>
               are some in this family you would love &amp;<lb/>
               esteem, and in the happiness of seeing that<lb/>
               belief confirmed I should I trust be satisfied<lb/>
               though you might be disappointed in in my little<lb/>
               self - <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickG1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</persName> and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickA1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Ticknor</persName> have set you the<lb/>
               example and shewn you the possibility of<lb/>

               <add>c</add>oming to the middle of Ireland and in spite<lb/>

               <lb/>
               - The <hi rend="underline">savage</hi> virtue of hospitality <unclear>in trouble</unclear> is not<lb/>
               yet gone from us - I wish you and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Dearborn<lb/>
               would seriously think of it and bring your Louisa<lb/>
               to us and arrange so as to make us a decently<lb/>
               long visit and not such a tantalizing short vis as<lb/>

               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickA1">agreeable Ticknors</persName> made us - They have<lb/>
               promised to come again before they return to their<lb/>
               own world - Suppose you were all to arrange to meet<lb/>
               at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Edgeworthstown_IE">Edgeworthtown</placeName> - Why not? -<lb/>

               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#NortA1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Norton</persName> sent me and <add>in</add> which your two<lb/>

               Edition of my Tales &amp; novels in 18 or vol<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. - which were<lb/>
               sent to me, <unclear>as</unclear> a present from <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickG1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ticknor</persName> - I am not<lb/>
               sure where <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TickG1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ticknor</persName> is at this moment <add>or</add> I would<lb/>

               books in any forms and they are charmed with<lb/>
               this beautiful <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#US">American</placeName> Edition - The paper is very<lb/>

               the <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#US">American</placeName> engravings are excellent - The<lb/>
               Vignette in <title ref="./Workography.xml#Helen1">the last volume of Helen</title>, the hawking<lb/>

               <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I have been unpardonable if I have never<lb/>
               written to thank you for the Translation you sent me<lb/>
               of "my prisons" - I have long had it and have it at<lb/>
               this moment before me with the inscription in the<lb/>
               front page written with your own kind hand<lb/>
               and signed <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ElioC1">C E Norton</persName> - I cannot believe that I never<lb/>
               <pb n="4" facs="Edgeworth_Princeton_1837-12_page04.jpg"/>

               wrote about it - I do think some letter of mine has<lb/>
               been lost - But I will not assert it as I am not<lb/>
               sure - Of this I am sure that I like your translation<lb/>
               very much - It reads quite like an original<lb/>
               - We never had it in English before <del>and</del> yours<lb/>
               came and we could only translate bits of it<lb/>
               to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#SneyM1">my Aunt Mary Sneyd</persName> - an old lady who enjoyed<lb/>
               it particularly - From your translation she<lb/>
               heard it afterwards in perfection, and now<lb/>
               she wishes to hear it again and we will begin<lb/>
               to read it to her again the moment we have <choice>

               </choice> a very disagreeable (though clever) novel<lb/>
               which we are now reading - And to which it is<lb/>

               <lb/>
               feelings it excites the greatest contrast imaginable<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>- The novel we are reading is <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TrolF1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Trollope'</persName>

               of Wrexhill</title> - It would lead me too far &amp; perhaps,<lb/>
               weary you to enter into any criticism of it - But<lb/>
               I wish <persName ref="./Personography.xml#NortA1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Norton</persName> would write a review of it for<lb/>
               Your excellent <title ref="./Workography.xml#North2">American Review</title> - It is a subject<lb/>
               worthy of him - &amp; he would treat it <del>so</del> well -<lb/>
               - It is not fair in fiction to draw a hypocrite or<lb/>
               heinously bad character as the representative of<lb/>
               certain religious tenets - <del>

               <lb/>
               I do not at all agree with the evangelical or Calvinestic<lb/>

               himself honestly, as a friend should, I now tell it with<lb/>

               (happily not named) But still so described that all who know<lb/>

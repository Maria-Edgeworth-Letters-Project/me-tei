               to go on very well<lb/>
                  together - but still<lb/>
               I cannot help wondering<lb/>
               at <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauH1">Harriet</persName>'s having<lb/>
                  liked him -<lb/>
               I believe your<lb/>

               will be tired reading<lb/>
               this letter - so I can<lb/>

               <salute>My dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName><lb/>
               </salute></opener>
              
              <p> I received your letter last Sunday, &amp; that I might<lb/>
               not overpower you by too rapid a rejoinder I have wasted<lb/>
               a whole week to begin my answer - in the first place<lb/>
               thank you most heartily for writing a long letter to<lb/>
                 <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewF1">Fanny Stewart</persName> - I think it will not only influence them<lb/>
               in their plans, but will calm her poor mind which<lb/>
               has of late been so feverish about coming home -<lb/>
               I cannot help feeling sometimes as if it was most<lb/>
               unnatural &amp; hard hearted of me to advise her to stay away<lb/>
               - but indeed I have written like any Roman to her - &amp; besides<lb/>
               I know it would be only changing from one poverty to another<lb/>
               &amp; that she would have any little more comfort of her friend.<lb/>
               I begged of her to try one year more at least. - I have<lb/>
               had a letter from her since I wrote to you in which she says<lb/>
                 that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewT1">Tom</persName> though quite tired of the country was determined to<lb/>
               try it longer, &amp; see if any thing would turn up through the<lb/>
               kindness of his friends. The Pastmastership has been negatived<lb/>
                 in the <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#BHouses-of-Parliament_ENK">Parliament</placeName> - &amp; as to the military road, their friend <persName ref="./Personography.xml#FostX1">Col: Foster</persName><lb/>
                 told <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewT1">Tom</persName> that it is out of the question, for none but military<lb/>
               people will be employed - so that at present they have not any <hi rend="underline">hope</hi><lb/>
               even of employment - &amp; are I suppose therefore more dispirited. It is curious<lb/>
                 that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ReidX1">Mr Ried</persName> who was the chief instigator of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewT1">Tom</persName>'s going to <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#XXC">Canada</placeName> should<lb/>
                 now advise them to return - he has assured <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewF1">Fanny</persName> that on their income w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi><lb/>
                 is <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>100 a year they could live more comfortably at home than in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#XXC">Canada</placeName> -<lb/>
                 He also tells <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewF1">Fanny</persName> that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewT1">Tom</persName>'s property in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName> will rise much in a few years<lb/>
                 - but how can this be - it consists of leases from <persName ref="./Personography.xml#DoneL1"><unclear>L. '</unclear> Donegal</persName>, which they have not<lb/>
            <unclear>received</unclear> - &amp; the whole income for the number of years they still will possess it<lb/>
               would not amount I understand to the debts &amp; interest which it is to pay<lb/>
                 <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewF1">Fanny</persName> says that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewT1">Tom</persName> will not tell her how it is circumstanced &amp; will<lb/>
               seldom speak of his affairs to her - it is a curious thing that in the 4 years<lb/>
                 they have been away, <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewT1">Tom</persName> has never heard from the trustees who were to manage<lb/>
               his property, any particulars of what they have done - nor have they even told<lb/>
               him what sum they received for his mills which were sold! He has written now<lb/> 
             
              <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_Huntington_FB1209_1826_09_17_page02.jpg"/> 
               now to enquire - what little might be done with his property in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName><lb/>
               is not done - &amp; no one here will make enquiry - all say they have no<lb/>
               right to enquire at all into the management of these assignees<lb/>
               But after all, it is only a sort of dream or castle building in the air<lb/>
               to talk of coming over next year - for he has not completed the<lb/>
               payment of his fees nor cleared all he is bound to do - &amp; till this<lb/>
               is done his <hi rend="underline">deed</hi> cannot be taken out by which his land will be<lb/>
            secured to him. This he told her himself the <add>last</add> letter mentioned<lb/>
                 I fear that poor <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewF1">Fanny</persName> will have but a miserable winter<lb/>
               altogether - between his grumpy silence &amp; irritability - &amp; the<lb/>
               extraordinary illness of her best maid, - and I cannot<lb/>
               help being uneasy about her own health which must<lb/>
               suffer I fear from anxiety vexation &amp; over work - without<lb/>
               one little counterbalancing delight of feeling that his love<lb/>
               &amp; his tenderness were unchanged<lb/>
                 They have had bears there &amp; at <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ReidX1">Mr Reid</persName>'s lately - seizing<lb/>
               the pigs which they nearly killed, but they were driven off<lb/>
               luckily in time to save them - The bears came again in<lb/>
               the night &amp; ate &amp; trampled great part of an uncommonly<lb/>
                 fine field of wheat all in ear of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StewT1">Tom</persName>s - &amp; I am much afraid<lb/>
               they will attack the children some times. I feel greatly &amp;<lb/>
               truly obliged to you for writing to her so fully - &amp; I know your<lb/>
               letter will be the greatest comfort to her she loves you so much<lb/>
               &amp; rests so much on your judgement.<lb/>
               Thank you for condescending to tell me your sentiments fully<lb/>
                 in regard to your opinion &amp; advice relative to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeL2">Lovell</persName>'s going abroad<lb/>
               I assure you I am most grateful whenever you can find time<lb/>
               to tell me any of your ideas or explain them to me - &amp; it has besides<lb/>
               the advantage of preventing all mistakes about you - for<lb/>
               there are many who, not sufficiently aware of my stupidity<lb/>
               &amp; insignificance, expect me to know your sentiments, &amp;<lb/>
               think that you probably have explained yourself or whatever<lb/>
            the point in question, may be, to me <add>&amp; then people mistake what I say &amp; think it your opinion</add>. - In this case I shall<lb/>
               feel the immediate effect probably - for in any conversation<lb/>
                 I have with <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Maria</persName> about it - I shall now go on sure grounds<lb/>
                 as I shall rest on your opinion. <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Edgeworthstown_IE">Edgeworths town</placeName> alas will<lb/>
               never be what it was - &amp; I fear much that all the efforts<lb/>
               to preserve it as the centre &amp; point of union of the family will<lb/>
               fail - &amp; sometimes I doubt butwhether the absence of the person who<lb/>
               is the nominal head of the family, will not hasten the ruin of the<lb/>
               whole. Yet on the other hand I do think it would be for the happiness<lb/>
                 of all if he could go abroad. <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Maria</persName> feels much at the Decision<lb/>
                 <pb n="3" facs="Edgeworth_Huntington_FB1209_1826_09_17_page03.jpg"/> 
               for his going or staying depending on her - for however her<lb/>
               judgement may be in favour of his going; - her heart rises against<lb/>
               the idea of condemning him to wander about about as he says an<lb/>
               outcast from the family.<lb/>
               I asked them as to the money to be had at low interest<lb/>
               -<del></del>He said he could not tell exactly any person to<lb/>
                 apply to, but that when he was in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK"><choice><orig>Eng.</orig><reg>England</reg></choice></placeName><hi rend="superscript">d</hi> last year he had<lb/>
               offers of it from various people - &amp; the manner in which<lb/>
               you can easily procure it - is by <hi rend="underline">advertising</hi> for money at<lb/>
                 low interest on Irish Mortgages. <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HughX2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persName> his agent at<lb/>
                 <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Cheltenham_ENK"><choice><orig>Chiltenham</orig><reg>Cheltenham</reg></choice></placeName> advertised, &amp; he had innumerable offers <hi rend="underline">at 4</hi><lb/>
               - &amp; at <hi rend="underline">our &amp; a quarter</hi> p<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>c<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. - He says if you advertise in<lb/>
                 <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> for it, you will <add>find</add> it very easily procured - This was all<lb/>
               I could learn for you about it -<lb/>
               What a very very provoking thing your not having<lb/>
                 received <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CrokX1"> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Croker</persName>'s letter - one day's delay would have<lb/>
               have given you a profitable employment - &amp; one which would<lb/>
                 not have detained you too long from <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauA1">Alicia</persName> -<lb/>
               &amp; <unclear>wo</unclear>uld have at least given me the pleasure<lb/>
               of <unclear>thi</unclear>nking that wherever you were you<lb/>
               were within reach, &amp; that some odd chance might bring<lb/>
               you to me - And now observe, &amp; profit by this experience<lb/>
               my dear Captain, if you had allowed one day to poor<lb/>
                 old <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Allenstown-Demesne_IE">Allens town</placeName>, to wander about with me in my ancient<lb/>
                 haunts, &amp; to indulge <persName ref="./Personography.xml#XxxxE1">Bess</persName> &amp; all your admirers there, You<lb/>
               would have had your letter in right time - you would<lb/>
               have had your purse somewhat filled - &amp; we should<lb/>
               - at least poor little I should have had one whole day passed<lb/>
               with you there to think of ever after - Since 1804 we never were<lb/>
               in that house together for more than a night - 22 Years!<lb/>
               - a long &amp; varied time to look back upon - Joy &amp; bitter grief - Gloom<lb/>
               &amp; brightness - failure &amp; success - all appear in ones <unclear>revisited</unclear><lb/>
               view of such a time - but in all these lights &amp; shadows, our friendship<lb/>
               remains <unclear>unclouded</unclear> unbroken &amp; you are still as you say in<lb/>
               your last command to me, my old friend &amp; brother &amp; Master -<lb/>
               And when the vanities &amp; flatterys of life have passed away, it<lb/>
               will be one pleasure at least to us to look back on the unchanged<lb/>
               affection of our whole lives - to me indeed greater than it can be to you,<lb/>
               because I know well my worthless inferiority -<lb/>
               I met a lady the other day, who on hearing my name asked if I had any<lb/>
               relation in the navy - I proudly said I had a brother - "I used to see him<lb/>
               frequently said she, many years ago. - When he was in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> waiting<lb/>
               for employment after a <unclear>hessie</unclear> action he had performed -<lb/>

               I was then young &amp; very romantic, &amp; I had the greatest admiration<lb/>
               of him - I thought him the first of heroes" - I said I would tell<lb/>
               you of her recollection of you - "oh no said she - tho' he frequently<lb/>
                 breakfasted at my brother's, I <del>never</del> scarcely ventured to speak to<lb/>
               him" - he would not remember me I am sure; - I admired him as<lb/>
                 a hero without venturing to speak to him" - Her brother was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <persName ref="./Personography.xml#AlexH1">Henry<lb/>

               I was very glad to come here just now to meet the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeH1"> Butlers</persName>. - I must say<lb/>

               Then we are agreed about <title ref="./Workography.xml#Littl1">the little plays</title> - an<lb/>
               hundred guineas for a <choice><orig>vol</orig><reg>volume</reg></choice> to match the size<lb/>
               of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Paren1">Parents Ass<del>s</del>istant</title>.  and permission to me to<lb/>

               deliver it to you - So far so good. But observe I<lb/>
               do not wish that the plays should appear as a<lb/>
               new work, only as an additional volume of a<lb/>
               new edition of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Paren1">Parents Assistant</title>. You do not say any thing<lb/>
               in reply to what I said about your letting the<lb/>

                    as you like

                    thanks for
                    <persName ref="./Personography.xml#DxxxA1">Sir A D's</persName>

            <p>Admirable! <hi rend="underline">indeed</hi> my dear
                    <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName>, is this preface to
                the library for the diffusion
                of useful knowledge - <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName>
                &amp; I have just finished reading
                it and I am impatient to
                pour out my admiration
                to you - I wish to God you
                had written it! - Is it
                possible that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrouH1">Brougham</persName>
                could write it - I cannot
                believe it - with his head his
                time so filled by politics
                No it is impossible - I can
                conceive that a man of his
                amazing versatility of
                powers &amp; compass of mind
                might when furnished by
                scientific friends with
                materials have put the
                facts together in a brilliant
                and striking manner - </p>
            <p>But it is the perfect sim-
                plicity &amp; usefulness - of this
                <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_Huntington_XXXX_1827_05_10_page02.jpg"/>
                essay that I admire - the perfect
                adaptation of the means to
                the end - the compression -
                the proportion in which the
                vast variety of knowledge
                is kept - (Oh on a small scale
                I know how difficult that
                is to effect -) This must
                have been the result of great
                labor &amp; great judgment -
                The knowledge must have
                been quite familiar to the
                mind to have come out
                at once so exact and so
                <unclear>easy</unclear> - &amp; so <hi rend="underline">well proportioned</hi>
                - again &amp; again. I must
                say so <hi rend="underline">well proportioned</hi>
                That is what strikes me as
                the greatest difficulty -</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="Edgeworth_Huntington_XXXX_1827_05_10_page03.jpg"/>
            <p>If <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrouH1">Brougham</persName> wrote it he
                is the most wonderful man
                of the age - I except not
                    <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CannG1">Canning</persName> - I would rather
                have written this were I
                a man than have spoken
                    <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CannG1">Cannings</persName> finest speech</p>
            <p>This calls new worlds

                manner - &amp; the author
                is not guilty of the egotism
                of "<hi rend="underline">I</hi> called the new world
                into existence" - </p>
            <p>Oh my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName>
                Now this essay would have
                delighted him who was
                most susceptible of any
                human being I ever knew
                of generous enthusiasm
                &amp; pleasure in the abilities
                of others - </p>
            <p>I see many things in that
                essay which prove the author
                had read <title ref="./Workography.xml#Botan1">

                The <hi rend="underline">fairy lamp</hi> has arrived
                - It is beautiful - <del/>
                Pray send me another for
                my aunt <persName ref="./Personography.xml#RuxtM1">Ruxton</persName> - It will be
                the most valuable because
                most useful present I can make
                her - Do not forget to send it,
                by <persName ref="./Personography.xml#StricX1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Strickland</persName> - in his waist-
                coat pocket - I know he would
                carry it for me if he had no
                room anywhere else - </p>
            <p>My dearest uncle - I perceive Maria
                has exhaled her expressions of admiration
                to you upon <title ref="./Workography.xml#Treat1">The Preliminary Treatise</title> - which
                is so beautifully done that it must be of use
                There is no person (not absolutely inept) who has
                not some one taste touched upon here to be
                roused or stimulated with a desire for improve
                -ment - whose curiosity will not be excited - I do
                not remember ever to have read anything with so
                much pleasure - Arising from what Metaphysicians
                call the fitness of things - each science &amp; each branch
                of that science is made to introduce the following
                so easily - so necessarily - There is besides a pleasure
                of the highest sort in the feeling of <hi rend="underline">excellence</hi> in
                any one thing - Who is the supremely happy
                man who has succeeded in executing such a <choice>

                  <reg>difficult</reg>
               </choice> task -? - If you know pray tell us directly
                - we are quite angry with <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HuntR1">Hunter</persName> now that
                we know <del>his</del> how much pleasure he detained
                from us so long - </p>
            <p>I hope you allow yourself time to read
                the debates - they are very interesting as <choice>
                  <orig>dis
                    plays</orig>
                  <reg>displays</reg>
               </choice> of individual character - &amp; trials of
                skill - How doubly interesting to those who
                can hear them - There must be so much
                in the changes of countenance &amp; the by
                play - where all <del/> is so personal that must be
                lost in cold black &amp; white. As to the power
                of language the <hi rend="underline">

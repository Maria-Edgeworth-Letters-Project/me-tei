               I would not put on the blister - She perspired<lb/>

               Her mind has been too much<lb/>

               consequence of such a vain sacrifice on
               her part. She declares to me that she
               feels no love for him - that she has re
               -peatedly told him so. Still he hopes
               on - Since he has had [insertion]a[/insertion] fair trial &
               that such is the result of her compa-
               risons & of her experience of her own
               feelings I think now the refusal sh[superscript]d[/superscript].
               for his sake & hers be decisive - & that
               [deletion]I have[/deletion] as soon as it has been given
               we should quit London & its neigh
               borhood - for the situation they are
               now in is harrassing & cruel to them
               both. I therefore decide to leave
               Hampstead on the 15[superscript]th[/superscript]. - [underline]till[/underline] that day
               we are engaged to [insertion]M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Carr &[/insertion] to Joanna Baillie.

               On the 15[superscript]th[/superscript]. we will return to
               Kensington Gore to Lady E W - who
               desired us to return to her on our
               road homewards to repose after
               the business should be decided - She
               was very anxious that it [underline]sh[superscript]d[/superscript]. be decided[/underline]
               as she thought the letting it go on longer
               would be disadvantageous to F in the
               eyes of the world & that it w[superscript]d[/superscript]. be said
               he had been encouraged. Besides she
               thought it cruel to him - for as long as
               he is permitted to see her he must & will
               [deletion](say what she will)[/deletion] nourish hope.

               Then on the 15[superscript]th[/superscript]. it is all over & we

               shall be with Lady E W. - The 16[superscript]th[/superscript]. & 17[superscript]th[/superscript]. we
               shall be there - That is till the middle of
               the day on the 17[superscript]th[/superscript]. - I have written this
               morning to M[superscript]r[/superscript]. & M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Hope to say [insertion]that [/insertion]we
               will be at the Deep Den on the 17[superscript]th[/superscript]. to dinner
               - We can stay there 3 or 4 days - When
               we are once beyond the reach of London
               & out of the reach of poor L W's hopes
               [underline]We[/underline] shall be I trust more at ease.

               I had arranged things differently
               - but seeing how much Fanny's health
               suffered from the struggle of her mind
               & the pain of giving pain or of indecision
               or of ... whatever it was ... I resolved to
               [underline]cut & run[/underline] as [deletion]fast[/deletion] [insertion]quickly[/insertion] as possible - The moment
               I felt assured that her real decision was

               part & I hope you will think so my
               dearest mother?

               When I had formerly understood
               that she desired more [underline]time[/underline] to make
               up her mind I had arranged to go to
               M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Hopes at the Deep Den from the 15[superscript]th[/superscript]
               to the 22[superscript]d[/superscript]. then to return to Town to give
               the 22 & 23[superscript]d[/superscript]. to M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Taddy who poor good
               natured woman has been anxious be-

               invited M[superscript]c[/superscript].Intosh & Lady C. Lindsay &
               the Lord knows who to meet us - But
               however sorry I am to disappoint
               her and break my own engagement
               this is but a trifle compared with
               Fanny's health & happiness - and
               As my dear father used to say the great
               art of life is to know how to sacrifice
               trifles to matters of consequence and
               to know what are trifles compared
               with great objects. I shall write to
               M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Taddy to state that some circum
               stances have occurred which render
               it absolutely necessary that we sh[superscript]d[/superscript].
               leave London immediately - and
               I am sure in saying this I speak truth
               - for I do think it absolutely necessary
               for dear Fan's health & peace of mind
               - She said the other day ."I am quite
               afraid of being touched by the feelings of
               the moment [insertion]of pity[/insertion] for him & being led to
               sacrifice my happiness & his "- and
               another time, she said

               "I know I shall be teized into mar
               "rying this man at last"

               You talk my dearest mother of
               your own indecision - But if you could
               know the agony of indecision I have
               been in these last days you would feel
               yourself quite resolute compared with me

               - Every change I saw in Fanny made me
               fear that I was mistaking her mind and
               doing wrong either by him or by her - you
               know how contradictory & inconsistent
               the human heart is in certain circum-
               stances . Sometimes F would say

               "[underline]But[/underline] I am giving up so much - such
               a noble generous character - I am sure
               I never shall be loved so much by any
               body else -"

               Then why refuse him - This ground
               gone over & over again in every possible
               light alternately frightened and reassured
               me and at last ... that is [underline]at this moment[/underline]
               I feel convinced that I see & that she sees
               to the bottom of her own heart - and that
               there is no love lurking there - Her esteem
               for him has been encreased by his conduct
               latterly - by his integrity [deletion]&[/deletion] generosity &
               wonderful power over himself - But
               the love, the first love which [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] was
               raised before there had been opportunity
               of comparison has completely [deletion]b[/deletion][insertion]v[/insertion]anished
               in consequence [insertion]I believe[/insertion] of the comparisons
               & reflexions she has had time & oppor
               tunity fully to make - She feels that he
               is not a companion fit for her - no litera
               ture no powers of conversation and tho
               his manners might be polished up [deletion]tolerable[/deletion]
               so as to pass in society yet habits would [unclear]recur[/unclear]

               - and [deletion]his[/deletion] then his family & connexions
               Though he says his wife should not be
               forced to live with them how [deletion]can[/deletion] c[superscript]d[/superscript]. it be
               otherwise without his breaking all his
               family ties & old intimacies . This w[superscript]d[/superscript].
               make him both despicable & unhappy
               - It must end by his wife's sinking to
               their level in society & [insertion]to their[/insertion] [deletion]m[/deletion] habits of
               mind. This Fanny feels & she knows
               that this would render her miserable
               - God forbid she sh[superscript]d[/superscript]. be so sacrificed.

               Your brother Francis behaves with
               all the candor & impartiality that c[superscript]d[/superscript].
               be expected from his character. He
               [underline]must[/underline] be sorry for his friend. But he
               never advocates his cause. Fanny
               has been left by him entirely to her
               own decision - He now agrees with
               me that they sh[superscript]d[/superscript]. separate as soon as
               possible -

               I fear I have been saying the same
               things over & over 100 times. But you will
               excuse it - my mind is so full of these
               thoughts it is a relief to me to pour them
               out to you dear mother - the person in
               the world who can sympathise most

               to day. sent the note by M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Carr who
               [deletion]goes[/deletion] went early to Town - Fanny has
               taken a good dose of castor oil this
               morning - is much better - still in bed
               - Miss Carr has been sitting beside her
               reading Rose's letters from Italy which
               have amused her while I have been

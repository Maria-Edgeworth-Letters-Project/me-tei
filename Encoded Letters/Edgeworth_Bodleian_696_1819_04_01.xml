               here yesterday - for my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny's</persName> sake<lb/>
               particularly. She had been at a French<lb/>
               play the night before we left Town and<lb/>
               caught cold <add>(She swears she had a cough before)</add> - She had a headache the next<lb/>

               here she went to bed. She was so hot &amp;<lb/>
               feverish in the night <del>that</del> and coughed<lb/>
               so much that I determined <add>as I told her in the middle of the night</add>
               <del>the next morn</del>
               <lb/>

               had taken this favorable turn in the<lb/>
               interval - However when <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HollP1">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. H</persName> came<lb/>
               he took me out to walk &amp; asked every<lb/>
               possible question - This <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">F</persName> does not know<lb/>
               - I am rather glad now the disagreeable<lb/>
               moment is over that he is not prescribing<lb/>
               on half knowledge - He gave her the night<lb/>
               before last two doses of antimony -<lb/>
               advised a blister on her chest if the pain<lb/>
               continued - But it did not continue &amp;<lb/>

               I would not put on the blister - She perspired<lb/>
               happily at night - much better tho<lb/>
               weak &amp; feverish all day.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Her mind has been too much<lb/>

               been forced to give him. We breakfast<lb/>

               it better that he should <add>not</add> - He shewed great<lb/>

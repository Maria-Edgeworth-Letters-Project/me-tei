               I had arranged things differently<lb/>

               As my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">father</persName> used to say the great<lb/>
               art of life is to know how to sacrifice<lb/>

               leave <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> immediately - and

               You talk my dearest mother of

               - Every change I saw in <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3"><persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName></persName> made me
               fear that I was mistaking her mind and
               doing wrong either by him or by her - you
               know how contradictory &amp;inconsistent
               the human heart is in certain circum-
               stances . Sometimes <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">F</persName> would say

               "<hi rend="underline">But</hi> I am giving up so much - such
               a noble generous character - I am sure

               I feel convinced that I see &amp;that she sees
               to the bottom of her own heart - and that
               there is no love lurking there - Her esteem
               for him has been encreased by his conduct

               wonderful power over himself - But

               Your brother <persName ref="./Placeography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName> behaves with

               anything to us .- I have written to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#WatkX2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.

               necessary. He means to have it out by Xmass

               all this family that you would be delighted
               with them as I am. So far from being any
               trouble to them I am sure it is a pleasure
               to them to do all they do for her &amp;they
               will like her all the better for the kind-
               ness they shew her. <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CarrF1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Carr</persName> is the most
               kind hearted motherly creature I have

               room - with a double door &amp;tiny anteroom

               I am sure these 3 rooms were intended
               from the Creation for the 3 Edgeworths they
               fit &amp;suit them so exactly.

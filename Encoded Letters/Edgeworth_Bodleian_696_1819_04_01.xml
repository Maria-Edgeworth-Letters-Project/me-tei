               consequence of such a vain sacrifice on
               her part. She declares to me that she

               I had arranged things differently
               - but seeing how much <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3"><persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName>'s</persName> health
               suffered from the struggle of her mind
               &amp;the pain of giving pain or of indecision

               however sorry I am to disappoint
               her and break my own engagement
               this is but a trifle compared with
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3"><persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName>'s</persName> health &amp;happiness - and
               As my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">father</persName> used to say the great
               art of life is to know how to sacrifice
               trifles to matters of consequence and
               to know what are trifles compared
               with great objects. I shall write to
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TaddX1"M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Taddy</persName> to state that some circum

               leave <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> immediately - and
               I am sure in saying this I speak truth

               - She said the other day ."I am quite

               You talk my dearest mother of

               know the agony of indecision I have

               - Every change I saw in <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3"><persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName></persName> made me
               fear that I was mistaking her mind and
               doing wrong either by him or by her - you
               know how contradictory &amp;inconsistent
               the human heart is in certain circum-
               stances . Sometimes <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">F</persName> would say

               "<hi rend="underline">But</hi> I am giving up so much - such
               a noble generous character - I am sure

               I feel convinced that I see &amp;that she sees
               to the bottom of her own heart - and that
               there is no love lurking there - Her esteem
               for him has been encreased by his conduct

               wonderful power over himself - But

               Your brother <persName ref="./Placeography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName> behaves with

               often &amp;be kind to him. This thought will

               I send Lovell a pamphlet &amp;notes

               Sir S. Romilly -

               Give my love to Sophy I enclose two Parisian
               visiting tickets elegant enough for her.
               I forgot to tell you that we had seen
               Lord Carrington - very kind but much [unclear]older[/unclear]
               in appearance &amp;much depressed in spirits
               - He says he will come &amp;see us here or
               will manage somehow that we shall
               meet - I wish it might be at High Wy-
               combe in our way homewards.

               I have seen Hunter lately . Have
               agreed to give him the whole of the M<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.
               in Sep<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.- He is to send me over the proof
               sheets. That operation will retard the
               publication but is in my opinion quite
               necessary. He means to have it out by Xmass
               - The first <del>part</del> vol is now going to press!-
               Thank you &amp;L for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Days picture - Say

               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> is so nursed and so loved by
               all this family that you would be delighted
               with them as I am. So far from being any
               trouble to them I am sure it is a pleasure
               to them to do all they do for her &amp;they
               will like her all the better for the kind-
               ness they shew her. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Carr is the most
               kind hearted motherly creature I have
               seen since I came to England - How fortu
               -nate we were to come here just at the
               moment we did. We have a deightful
               airy bedchamber with chearful bow win-
               dow - large bed for <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> &amp;me - a room
               adjoining for Honora &amp;a little dressing
               room - with a double door &amp;tiny anteroom
               that shuts out all noise - As M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Carr says
               I am sure these 3 rooms were intended
               from the Creation for the 3 Edgeworths they
               fit &amp;suit them so exactly.

               M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Carr! - Oh mother I <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> envy
               these dear good girls the happiness of
               the affection they have for their father
               - If you could see them all from the eldest
               to the youngest running to the gate to
               meet him as he rides home on his white
               horse!- He is <hi rend="underline">one</hi> of the very happiest
               men I ever saw - of the happiest temper
               - working hard all day, usefully &amp;hono
               rably &amp;coming home every evening to
               such a happy cultivated united family
               - When he sits down to dinner in the midst
               of his children he says he throws aside
               170

               [end of page thirteen]

               every care for the remainder <add>of the day</add> &amp;enjoys
               himself - He is passionately fond of draw
               ing and music &amp;one daughter draws
               admirably &amp;another plays &amp;sings ad-
               mirably - and all their accomplishments
               are for him &amp;for their own family.

               They are really happy people - Certain-
               ly <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> has had the advantage of
               seeing a greater variety of the insides
               of families of all ranks than could
               have been expected.- even by my san-
               guine imagination

               I enclose two para graphs which
               appeared in the Times - Perhaps they
               might never strike your eye if you
               were not aware that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Carr is Sol<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. to the
               Excise - These paragraphs will shew
               you how high he stands in public esti-
               mation.

               D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wollaston dines here tomorrow &amp;I
               have leave to ask Capt<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. B. to dine to
               meet him - Many of them whose names
               I cannot recollect are expected - If Fan
               ny is well we shall be happy.

               I cant wait to see D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. H. he is
               so late - <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> is better <add>&amp;drinking arrow root</add> - keep your
               mind easy - I will write again tomorrow

               I am that I have neglected the advantage &amp; the honour of that<lb/>

               I cannot imagine, but to me it has given many a twinge of<lb/>
               conscience, &amp; most particularly in the affair of letter writing which, if<lb/>
               I have happenned to delay a little too long, always becomes difficult to me<lb/>
               beyond imagination. Days pass, &amp; the more honour &amp; esteem I have for my<lb/>

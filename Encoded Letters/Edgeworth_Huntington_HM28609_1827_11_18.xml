               Letter N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. 1 - and 2 will show
               you that I took every precaution
               to assure myself that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HuntX1">Hunter</persName>
               was not a loser by my chang
               ing the title of H &amp; L - I have
               not kept any copies of my letters
               but I daresay <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HuntX1">Hunter</persName> has
               my letter of Feb 1826 in wh<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>
               I offered then to deduct from
               the copy right whatever he after

               sh<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>find <add>or <hi rend="underline">think</hi>
               </add> he had lost by the

               1826</date> - declines accepting my<lb/>

               accepts my offer of delaying<lb/>

               delay the promised payment<lb/>
               for another year - but without<lb/>
               even hinting that he had lost<lb/>
               by the publication - I acceded<lb/>
               to the delay - &amp; told him (of course)<lb/>
               that I would not take the <unclear>int</unclear>
               <lb/>
               which he offered -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I make no doubt that<lb/>
               his statements of <hi rend="underline">accounts</hi> are<lb/>
               true - but I think his losses<lb/>
               may in great measure arise<lb/>
               from his own mismanagement<lb/>
               for which I am not answerable.<lb/>
               - I hope my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName> you<lb/>
               will approve of my letter to<lb/>
               him &amp; of my not making<lb/>
               any hesitation in acceding<lb/>
               to his proposal though I certainly<lb/>
               do not feel that I am bound<lb/>
               either by promise or honor<lb/>
               to accede to it -<lb/>
               I leave the letter in your<lb/>

               wish altered I am sure you<lb/>
               will tell me so -<lb/>
               Fortunately - or I may say prudently<lb/>
               I have not pledged or spent any<lb/>
               part of this <unclear>100 £</unclear>- though I own<lb/>

               I lose in reality -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>When <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrewD1">Doctor Brewster</persName> was<lb/>
               here a few months ago he kindly<lb/>
               urged me to let him and a<lb/>
               society of literary men at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Edinburgh_STK">

                  </choice>
               </placeName> publish any future<lb/>
               book for me - he assured me<lb/>
               that as they employ printers<lb/>
               without the <hi rend="underline">middleman</hi> called<lb/>
               a publisher they find they can<lb/>
               afford to give more copyright<lb/>
               than is usually given by publishers<lb/>
               - When I told him what <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HuntX1">Hunter</persName>
               <lb/>
               was to give me for <title ref="./Workography.xml#Early2">H &amp; L</title> - he<lb/>
               said we could give you a third<lb/>
               more - When he spoke of a future<lb/>

               <add>book</add> which I had told him<lb/>
               I was thinking of beginning to<lb/>
               write he urged me to consider<lb/>
               my own interest I replied that<lb/>
               I felt myself engaged to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HuntX1">Hunter</persName>
               <lb/>
               and that whether engaged or<lb/>
               not I never would quit him<lb/>
               as long as he should continue<lb/>
               to wish to publish for me -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But what he has now written<lb/>
               to me I think alters the case -<lb/>
               and as he assures me that he<lb/>
               is no gainer by my publications<lb/>
               do you not think I am now<lb/>
               right in telling him as I do in<lb/>
               my letter that all accounts are<lb/>
               closed between us? -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>You perceive that I have<lb/>
               not hinted to him anything<lb/>
               of my intention to write a new<lb/>

               will understand me - I had been<lb/>

               about certain premature &amp;<lb/>
               luckily falsified announcements<lb/>
               of autumn 1846 that I was<lb/>

               announcements at all on this<lb/>
               occasion &amp; in fact I never<lb/>
               quite convinced myself that<lb/>
               the thing was certain until<lb/>
               I signed the contract. It was<lb/>
               all done in railway time<lb/>

               I am satisfied well bestowed.<lb/>
               so let us hear no more about my<lb/>
               foolish silence. Moreover, I<lb/>
               was far from well &amp; the row<lb/>

               &amp; unusually admired in<lb/>

               only 35, he has already laid by<lb/>
               a sufficient independence - his<lb/>

               of the most respectable kind. To<lb/>

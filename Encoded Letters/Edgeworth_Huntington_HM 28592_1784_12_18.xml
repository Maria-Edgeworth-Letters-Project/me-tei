               whom he (Saiza) has thereupon raised to be his <unclear>favorite</unclear><lb/>

               to marry his Daughter Theana &amp; by that means to raise<lb/>
               his family &amp; himself to the throne - he leads Mirza into all<lb/>
               <del></del> sorts of dissipation, squanders away the public<lb/>

               begins to see the character of his favorite &amp; suspects Theana<lb/>

               The King replies, that tho he is himself an Enemy to Aider -<lb/>
               he will never join with a Traitor against - This is the<lb/>
               exact historical Answer - The proud &amp; generous mind<lb/>
               of Mirza is stung to the Quick by this Reproach -<lb/>
               He is haunted by remorse - detests his favorite -<lb/>

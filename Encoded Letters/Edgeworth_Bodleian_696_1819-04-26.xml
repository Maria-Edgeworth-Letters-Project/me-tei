            <p>Dearest <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF2">Mother</persName>; Here we are again with<lb/>
            this kind friend <persName ref="./Personography.xml#WhitE1">Lady Elizabeth W.</persName> who met us with open arms &amp; open heart at<lb/>
            met us with open arms &amp; open heart at<lb/>
            the head of the stairs when we returned<lb/>
            and made us feel immediately at home<lb/>
            again in her house and as if we had <choice><orig>ne-<lb/>
            ver</orig><reg>never</reg></choice> separated from her. Every thing in our<lb/>
            rooms prepared in perfect comfort for<lb/>
            us. The low arm chair at the fire - the foot<lb/>
            stool - the writing table turned <del>to</del> the right<lb/>
            way for the light for me - Oh my dear <choice><orig>mo-<lb/>
            ther</orig><reg>mother</reg></choice> politeness in the manner of doing<lb/>
            kindness, as you and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#RuxtM1">Aunt Ruxton</persName> so<lb/>
            well know adds incalculably to the<lb/>
            value of the favors conferred.<lb/></p>

            <p><persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> who is scribbling to you<lb/>
            says she has told you what a dreary drive<lb/>

            how completely we were prevented from<lb/>
            enjoying the sight of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Richmond_ENK">Richmond</placeName> by rain &amp;<lb/>
            fog. I came round by <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Richmond_ENK">Richmond</placeName> on<lb/>
            purpose because my <persName ref="./Personography.xml#RuxtM1">aunt R</persName> was so<lb/>
            fond of it and I wanted to see &amp; to shew it to<lb/>
            my companions. <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> had seen it &amp;<lb/>
            (had her own recollections! -) But we have<lb/>
            had so few little disappointments of this<lb/>
            sort during our journies that we <hi rend="underline">have no </hi>right<lb/>
            to complain<lb/></p>

            <p>  <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fan</persName> has told you of M<hi rend="superscipt">r</hi>. &amp; M<hi rend="superscipt">rs</hi>. Waldegrave<lb/>
            &amp; all we have heard from them - <del>So</del><lb/>
            I have written to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#GreyC1">Lord Grey</persName> to ask<lb/>
            when &amp; where I may present <add><unclear>little</unclear></add> <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF1">Francis</persName> to him<lb/></p>

            <p> <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HollP1">D<hi rend="superscipt">r</hi>. Holland</persName> dines here tomorrow<lb/>
            and you shall hear immediately what he<lb/>
            says of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName>. But I know all he can say<lb/>
            is that he is <hi rend="underline">proud</hi> to see her looking so well<lb/>
            - <persName ref="./Personography.xml#WhitS1">M<hi rend="superscipt">r</hi>. S Whitbread</persName> asked yesterday evening<lb/>
            whether I would trust him to ride with her<lb/>
            - He had heard me say when I was here<lb/>
            before that riding was good for her &amp; that<lb/>
            I wished she could ride. He had a nice little<lb/>
            poney which <persName ref="./Personography.xml#XxxxJ3">Jack</persName> said is as safe and which<lb/>
            he was sure she w<hi rend="superscipt">d</hi>. like - <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> &amp; I accepted<lb/>
            this kind offer and she has had a delightful<lb/>
            ride in the park with <persName ref="./Personography.xml#XxxxJ2">Jack</persName> riding behind<lb/>
            them - After <persName ref="./Personography.xml#XxxxJ2">Jack</persName> had gone a few yards<lb/>
            he said he must turn back he bethought him<lb/>
            thus the silk hand<unclear><hi rend="superscipt"></hi></unclear>. he had tied round his<lb/>
            neck was not smart enough or as he said<lb/>
            <hi rend="underline">respectful enough for riding with a lady</hi><lb/>
            so back he went to equip himself more<lb/>
            to his notions of propriety<lb/></p>

            <p> Good natured <persName ref="./Personography.xml#GranX2">Miss Grant</persName> ( <add>of the</add> dear<lb/>
            <persName ref="./Personography.xml#RuxtM1">Aunt Mary</persName> kind) came out with me &amp;<lb/>
            &amp; walked without her bonnet &amp; with<lb/>
            one end of her shawl round her &amp; the other<lb/>
            end round myself up the <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Kensington_ENK">Kensington</placeName> road<lb/>
            to the park for the pleasure of seeing them<lb/>

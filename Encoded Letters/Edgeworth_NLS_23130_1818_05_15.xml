                    from the same abundant and concealed source. I do assure you<lb/>

                    I am quite an impartial judge upon the occasion &amp; that you do me<lb/>
                    too much honour in supposing that I have any interest in these <choice>

                    somebody Gordon about my having intimated to him any acquiescence<lb/>
                    in the report of my being the author of <del/>
               <title ref="./Workography.xml#Antiq1">Antiquary</title> is so absolutely<lb/>
                    false that I do not even know such a person I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> know <persName ref="./Personography.xml#GordA1">Sir <unclear>Alex</unclear>.<lb/>

                    you I know hold as highly as I do; so that I suppose she has already<lb/>

                    It was destined I was not to find the letter until I returned hither for<lb/>
                    an unfortunate partiality for little cabinets and great cabinets and<lb/>
                    all sort of concealments and pigeon-holes holes makes it very difficult for me<lb/>
                    to know where any particular paper may happen to be <unclear/> I regret that<lb/>
                    the delay this has occasioned may make me seem what I would most<lb/>
                    unwillingly be thought slack or careless in complying with your request<lb/>
                    The letter contains an excellent and animated defence of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#DarwE1">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin</persName> written<lb/>
                    with the spirit and feeling which your late respected relative was most<lb/>
                    likely to have exerted in behalf of a freind. Still however it does not<lb/>
                    appear to me to shake the powerful evidence that the lines in dispute<lb/>
                    were claimed by <persName ref="./Personography.xml#SewaA1">Miss Seward</persName> during <persName ref="./Personography.xml#DarwE1">Doctor Darwins</persName> lifetime and pub<lb/>
                    lished as hers and with her name. After all I do not think the verses<lb/>
                    very much were worth struggling about. But the liberality of the letter does great<lb/>
                    honour (like everything thing he did) to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">Mr. E.s</persName> memory. I found in the same<lb/>
                    drawer a letter of my own to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">Mr. Edgeworth</persName> begun after my release from<lb/>
               <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#FR">France</placeName> and never finished: a memorial among too many others how<lb/>

                    as for the last twelve months I have had very indifferent health to plead as<lb/>
                    an excuse for being an irregular correspondent. I begin within these<lb/>
                    two last months to feel like myself again so that I trust I shall not<lb/>
                    have that painful apology any longer.<lb/>

            <p>I am much obliged to you for thinking favourably of my attempts in poetry<lb/>
                    They have one title to indulgent compassion which is that they are a sort of <choice>

                    part of my literary life partly from temper partly from principle having observed<lb/>
                    how very unhappy library persons are made (not to say ridiculous into the <choice>

                    to avoid at least that frailty &amp; think as little about my poems when committed<lb/>
                    to the public as I well could. It is only when you <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth</persName> or a few others<lb/>
                    whose talents &amp; candour rank high with me are kind enough to say that you<lb/>
                    receive pleasure from these poems that I ever think of them with satisfaction or<lb/>
                    indeed <add>think of them</add> at all. I have not read one of them since they were printed excepting<lb/>
                    last year <title ref="./Workography.xml#Ladyo1">the Lady of the Lake</title> which I liked better than I expected but not<lb/>
                    well enough to induce me to go through the rest so I may truly say with<lb/>

                    This much of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Macbe1">Macbeth</title> I recollect for that is not so easily forgotten that<lb/>
                    she was attempted from the existing person &amp; character of a lady who is now<lb/>
                    no more. So that I am particularly flattered with your distinguishing it<lb/>

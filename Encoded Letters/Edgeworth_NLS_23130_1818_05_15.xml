                    an unfortunate partiality for little cabinets and great cabinets and<lb/>
                    all sort of concealments and pigeon-holes holes makes it very difficult for me<lb/>

                    The letter contains an excellent and animated defence of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#DarwE1">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin</persName> written<lb/>
                    with the spirit and feeling which your late respected relative was most<lb/>

                    appear to me to shake the powerful evidence that the lines in dispute<lb/>

                    honour (like everything thing he did) to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">Mr. E.s</persName> memory. I found in the same<lb/>

                    to avoid at least that frailty &amp; think as little about my poems when committed<lb/>
                    to the public as I well could. It is only when you <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth</persName> or a few others<lb/>
                    whose talents &amp; candour rank high with me are kind enough to say that you<lb/>

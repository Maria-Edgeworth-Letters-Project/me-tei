               Every one of<lb/>
               the letters which you so very<lb/>
               kindly wrote to us reached<lb/>
               us yesterday - <hi rend="underline">Thank you</hi><lb/>
               I cannot express how much<lb/>
               I feel obliged by your writing<lb/>
               all this in your situation<lb/>
               - However dreadful the de-<lb/>
               tails there is a sort of satisfac<lb/>
               tion in knowing the truth<lb/>
               &amp; being relieved from suspense<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               - do you say the best we<lb/>
               can now hope is that this<lb/>
               noble creature may not sur<lb/>
               vive the loss of all that dis-<lb/>
               tinguished him among men<lb/>
               &amp; that he may without more<lb/>
               suffering breathe his last -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               - You surely cannot doubt<lb/>
               that we should think you<lb/>
               did right in sending the<lb/>
               young ones to Castle Forbes<lb/>
               - nothing could be better<lb/>
               - God bless Lady G - You have<lb/>
               a great comfort even in these<lb/>
               terrible circumstances in<lb/>

               feeling <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> that wherever<lb/>
               your daughters &amp; sons are<lb/>
               they are in all that depends<lb/>
               on their own conduct safe -<lb/>
               and must do you credit<lb/>

               Honora seemed to enjoy<lb/>
               her journey &amp; the open carriage<lb/>
               - fine weather and change<lb/>
               of scene more even than you<lb/>
               could possibly have expected<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               - Her mind is admirably<lb/>
               calm - &amp; more easily amused<lb/>
               than my own - Anna is<lb/>
               as you well know all kind<lb/>
               ness - and she has such delight<lb/>
               ful soft manners <del>ha</del><lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               Honora had such a headache<lb/>
               yesterday (the only one she has<lb/>
               had since we left Black Castle)<lb/>
               that I was glad we had not<lb/>
               received an answer to a note<lb/>
               I wrote Em. to say we w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. go there<lb/>
               yesterday - we have heard<lb/>
               from her to day - a very kind<lb/>
               note -. In an hours time we<lb/>
               are going - Honora's head pretty<lb/>
               well - as soon as I see how<lb/>
               things are at Clifton I will write<lb/>
               to you again - I have read your<lb/>

               letter to Aunt C - and will deli<lb/>
               ver it as I think her mind<lb/>
               is strong enough to bear the<lb/>
               truth and itm ust come<lb/>
               sooner or later - The shock might<lb/>
               be much worse if it came all<lb/>
               at once -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               I did not receive from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.<lb/>
               Little <hi rend="underline">the Bond</hi> - so I shall say<lb/>
               nothing of business &amp; hope no-<lb/>
               thing will be said to me - If<lb/>
               the subject is touched upon I shall<lb/>
               say that Lovell &amp; Sneyd had<lb/>
               ordered a bond to be drawn<lb/>
               but that it was not ready -<lb/>

            <p>
               We shall stay till Thursday<lb/>
               I think - We have desired<lb/>
               Anna to forward any Irish<lb/>
               letters to us - as we <hi rend="underline">live</hi> upon<lb/>
               your letters - My dear Fanny<lb/>
               wrote to me from Castle Forbes<lb/>
               so we know every thing about<lb/>
               you all as if we were with<lb/>
               you - I hope my dear mother<lb/>
               you continue to think <del>I</del> we<lb/>
               did right <del><unclear></unclear></del> in com-<lb/>
               ing to England - If you wished<lb/>
               for us back again say but the<lb/>
               word and we will come at<lb/>
               any time - Thank God you will<lb/>
               tell me the truth -<lb/>

               letter from Lady Lansdowne<lb/>
               begging us to come to her as<lb/>
               soon as possible - I shall not<lb/>
               answer till we have seen my<lb/>
               aunts - I think it would be<lb/>
               dreadful to go into <hi rend="underline">company</hi><lb/>
               at present - and could not answer<lb/>
               any purpose for Honora - nor<lb/>
               could it be even proper - There-<lb/>
               fore I wish to put off the visit -<lb/>
               <del>I will write</del> As soon as I get to Clifton<lb/>
               &amp; hear what my aunts say - I will<lb/>
               write to Lady L- and to Dumont<lb/>
               - I will tell Lady L my brother<lb/>
               is exceedingly ill - that we do<lb/>
               not wish &amp;c - &amp; I will write to<lb/>
               D- to ask if he can now read the<lb/>
               M<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. <add>I will send it to him</add> &amp; if I <hi rend="underline">can</hi> see him in Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.<lb/>
               or if he stays at Bowood suppose<lb/>
               in Sep<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.? Anna asks us to stay<lb/>
               here a fortnight &amp; promises she<lb/>
               will let no company in - that<lb/>
               she will say at once W. has a<lb/>
               fever &amp; that is sufficient answer<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>

               saying she never pitied a creatures<lb/>
               so much in her life as she does<lb/>
               Fanny &amp; you - that F is the picture<lb/>

               fondness <add>&amp; admiration</add> of P. &amp; F- -&amp; says they are<lb/>
               not the slightest trouble - to E's state<lb/>

               - I wrote to your ex brother &amp; have had<lb/>
               a most touchingly kind letter from<lb/>
               him - D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Baillie is very ill &amp; I have<lb/>

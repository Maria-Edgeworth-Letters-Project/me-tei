               I think my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinE1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brinkley</persName> I may firmly<lb/>
               believe that you have never received a little<lb/>
               note from me expressing my thanks and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeL1">Lucy's</persName>
               <lb/>
               for the roots you were so good as to send <unclear>here</unclear> - So<lb/>
               let me now begin by saying that we are very much<lb/>
               obliged to you for recollecting us - and hoping they<lb/>
               may brilliantly and sweetly received us of you &amp;<lb/>
               the dear <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Dunsink-Observatory_IE">Observatory</placeName> when this horrid writing weather<lb/>
               leaves us - and Spring returns to us once more<lb/>
               Since the above was written our delayed post has brought a<lb/>
               letter from my sister and we are all shocked and grieved to hear<lb/>
               that the fever has got into that dear <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Dunsink-Observatory_IE">Observatory</placeName> - and that so<lb/>
               many of your family are suffering from it - I trust in<lb/>
               God that their valuable lives may be spared and that<lb/>
               you dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinE1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brinkley</persName> will escape without taking it-<lb/>
               How happy dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinS1">Sally</persName> must be at having <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinJ1">her father</persName> with<lb/>

               </placeName> and that both<lb/>

               with the people around you and that the climate had<lb/>

               I think my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinE1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brinkley</persName> I may firmly<lb/>
               believe that you have never received a little<lb/>
               note from me expressing my thanks and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeL1">Lucy's</persName>
               <lb/>
               for the roots you were so good as to send <unclear>here</unclear> - So<lb/>
               let me now begin by saying that we are very much<lb/>
               obliged to you for recollecting us - and hoping they<lb/>
               may brilliantly and sweetly received us of you &amp;<lb/>
               the dear <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Dunsink-Observatory_IE">Observatory</placeName> when this horrid writing weather<lb/>
               leaves us - and Spring returns to us once more<lb/>
               Since the above was written our delayed post has brought a<lb/>
               letter from my sister and we are all shocked and grieved to hear<lb/>
               that the fever has got into that dear <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Dunsink-Observatory_IE">Observatory</placeName> - and that so<lb/>
               many of your family are suffering from it - I trust in<lb/>
               God that their valuable lives may be spared and that<lb/>
               you dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinE1">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brinkley</persName> will escape without taking it-<lb/>
               How happy dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinS1">Sally</persName> must be at having <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinJ1">her father</persName> with<lb/>
               her! I had heard from my <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1" cert="high">brother</persName> and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauA1" cert="high">sister</persName> Beaufort<lb/>
               that they had been to see you at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Cloyne_IE">
                  <unclear>Cloyne</unclear>
               </placeName> and that both<lb/>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinE1">you</persName> and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinJ1">the Bishop</persName> were pleased with your residence and<lb/>
               with the people around you and that the climate had<lb/>
               agreed wonderfully well with both - Indeed the<lb/>
               climate in the South is any mild and very charming.<lb/>
               Here we have had the most odious weather interminable<lb/>
               winds and snows in impassable drifts - The Lawyers<lb/>
               &amp; judges of the N. W. Circuit have been much delayed<lb/>

            <p>
               I shd not have
               let others be before me in men-
               -tioning my little woman's intended
               wedding, but that at the time
               when I found her romance near
               its last chapter, I was afflicted
               sadly by recurring reports of
               evil abot her uncle in India
               which indeed [underline]for me[/underline] made it
               impossible [unclear]to enter[/unclear] rightly at the
               feelings of the younger generation.
               Moreover I was then as I am
               still in a poor uncomfortable
               state of health myself - but of
               that no more. And I know how
               heartily you will rejoice that I can
               now

              report favourably as this W. [unclear][/unclear]
              I had by last mail a letter from
              himself dated 22[superscript]d[/superscript] October. He
              had removed on the 10[superscript]th[/superscript] to the
              home of a friend of his &amp; relation
              &amp; namesake of mine some few
              miles on the way frm Bangalore
              to Madras. During the intervening
              days he had been sensibly
              gathering strength &amp; he &amp; his wife
              &amp; his host (whose letters also I
              have seen) concurred in
              thinking that he w[superscript]d[/superscript] speedily
              be able to continue his journey
              and embark for England. He
              cd have no other chance but in
              the sea voyage &amp; home of a
              [note]48[/note]
              permanent care after a most
              severe case of [unclear]abscess[/unclear] in the
              liver. I hope &amp; trust I shall
              have him here anon &amp; that
              his constitution may have
              so rallied as [unclear]&amp;[/unclear] to afford him
              the prospect of a tranquil
              Evening of life in the country.
              That he shd be well enough
              for active service, at least
              for several years to come, my
              medical friends assure me is
              in the highest degree improbable.
              Since you will not come to
              Londn I must go to Ireland
              &amp; bye &amp; bye I am likely to be
              a free batchelor

               Eugh! My son is daily expecting
               to join his regimt at Canterbury
               &amp; Miss Charlotte will I suppose
               be taken fr me at Easter
               or at latest in the Summer.
               They are both now in Scotland
               where had I been well engh
               to travel I shd have been
               w them at Chrs for line season
               - but that over they will come
               up without delay. They have
               had a very happy Summer &amp;
               Autum there &amp; [underline]he[/underline] may
               not have the like again
               for years to come.

               Charlotte will be a terrible
               loss to my fireside - but I
               must consider how soon the
               railway is to annihilate
               distance - &amp; let any rate
               I am not so silly as to
               let my thoughts rest on anything
               but the great comfort of
               knowing that she is to be
               provided w a kind protector
               of her own standing in place
               of[insertion]a[/insertion] worn &amp; weary papa
               I think myself entitled
               to count on [unclear]her[/unclear] many chances

               as most fathers ought to
               anticipate of a tranquil
               &amp; happy lot for my

               her [underline]promisso[/underline] is within
               15 miles of my brother's
               place, so that in days to

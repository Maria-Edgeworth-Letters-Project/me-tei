               — for instance - circumstances
               I have privately learned from
               catholics respecting late distur
               bances in this Town of Navan
               — and elsewhere —
               The hand of despotism
               may press down &amp; [underline]keep[/underline] down
               a nation if that hand be strong
               enough — But the hand must
               [deletion]be[/deletion] in that case [underline]never be removed[/underline]
               &amp; must never relax —
               To the conqueror of Waterloo
               The [underline]reco[/underline]nquest of Ireland would
               appear &amp; be easy perhaps; & there
               fore his [unclear]mil[superscript]n[/superscript][/unclear] genius may brave
               & despise the danger of putting
               things to this issue — But — after
               wards — he must be prepared
               to exterminate - he can
               no otherwise extinguish [insertion]public[/insertion] opinion
               Cromwell — who was better
               made for the purpose than
               any other man stopped short
               of the mark & after wading
               through slaughter to his
               church left 50,000 to tell
               the tale —
               But I have no business with
               these things --
               NB. I do not think from what I have
               heard that the priests would dare
               to let themselves be paid by Govt
               unless [unclear][underline] Cat - eman[/underline][/unclear]. were same time granted
               — Great debating may be upon the means
               & tenets of said words — we shall hear from
               the Pope I suppose soon — & from you? — When?
               You were so very kind to

               "I foresaw would be a distinguished
               "man when I met him at Edward
               "Smedley's chambers at Trinity"
               It will gratify me and
               my brother much if you can
               give him half an hour of
               your conversation — I enclose
               a note for him — Send it by
               2[superscript]d[/superscript] post. It contains a little note
               of introduction for him to you
               which is all I can do for him
               He is a more literary man
               than William & having seen
               a great deal of the world
               abroad for many years has
               more that will make half an
               hour's conversation agreeable
               to you — Oblige me — and I shall
               be obliged — which is more than
               many people who ask favors
               [underline]can promise[/underline] or at least more
               than they are often found to per
               form
               I am Yours very sincerely

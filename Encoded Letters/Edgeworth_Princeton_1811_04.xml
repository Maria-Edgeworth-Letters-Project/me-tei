            <p>I am not quite sure whether my flattering <choice>

                  <reg>curiosity</reg>
               </choice> they express. I am gratified to find that the<lb/>
               Frankland Family have inspired so much in interest<lb/>
               as to make the readers of their history take the trouble<lb/>
               of enquiring about their wedding apparel. I have<lb/>
               received various letters on the subject but none so<lb/>
               complimentary and so urgent as that I am now<lb/>
               answering...Very fortunately for the three brides<lb/>
               it happened that there was a short time previous<lb/>
               to their marriages a custom house officers sale in<lb/>
               <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Monmouth_WLK">Monmouth</placeName> of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TipsX1">Admiral Tipsey's</persName> smuggled goods.<lb/>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HungX2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hungersford</persName> presented to the three brides three<lb/>
               gowns of French cambric purchased at this sale<lb/>
               which were made up in the neatest manner<lb/>
               possible by the best milliner in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Monmouth_WLK">Monmouth</placeName> and<lb/>
               trimmed with some of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TipsX1">Admiral Tipsey's</persName> best satin<lb/>
               <unclear/> lace. The dress maker assured me that no<lb/>
               thing could be <hi rend="underline">more</hi> becoming <hi rend="underline">than</hi> the <hi rend="underline">set</hi> of<lb/>
               the vandyke collars about the necks.<lb/>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HungX2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hungersfords</persName> children provided French white<lb/>

               in which he was right glad he had no concern<lb/>
               bought the very pretty veils of French manufacture<lb/>
               which he presented to the brides Frank put them<lb/>

               on his sisters with so good a grace that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ClegX2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cleghorn</persName> begged he would also put on his<lb/>
               daughter's veil, that she might look as well as<lb/>
               the Franklands. <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CrumJ1">Mr Jos <unclear>Crumpe</unclear>
               </persName> whose English<lb/>
               blood could not bear the idea of the girls<lb/>
               being Frenchified from <hi rend="underline">top</hi> to <hi rend="underline">toe</hi> insisted that<lb/>
               at least they might have some thing English<lb/>
               about them and accordingly presented each<lb/>
               with half a dozen pair of such beautiful fine<lb/>
               cotten stockings, as cannot be had for love or<lb/>
               money now a days out of honest old <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName>.<lb/>
               on the same principle he gave htem white <unclear>chip</unclear>
               <lb/>
               hats trimmed with <hi rend="underline">English</hi>
               <hi rend="underline">white</hi> ribbon "for<lb/>
               say what you will of French white ribbon, what they<lb/>
               call white is no more white than I am I declare"<lb/>
               Gowns, hats, veils, gloves, shoes, stockings, nothing<lb/>
               wanting but white <unclear/> handkerchiefs, which<lb/>
               old <persName ref="./Personography.xml#FranJ1">Frankland</persName>, who utterly detested shawls begged<lb/>
               his girls would wear and <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ClegX1">Miss Cleghorn</persName> had<lb/>
               also the complaisance to wear one, tho' she had<lb/>
               a fine French shawl, which the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TipsX1">Admiral</persName> forced<lb/>
               upon her acceptance. I cannot learn that they<lb/>
               had such necklaces, bracelets or baubles of any kind,<lb/>
               but they certainly had prayer books neatly<lb/>
               bound in morocco; the gift of young <persName ref="./Personography.xml#JoliX1">Mr <unclear>Jolingsby</unclear>

               so much for the Brides, now for the Bridegrooms<lb/>
               who had first intended to be <unclear>dressed</unclear> alike but<lb/>
               Frank objected, "lest it should look like an <unclear/>

               <lb/>
               on that point, that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HungX2">Mrs Hungerford</persName> was dressed<lb/>
               in an <unclear/>
               <unclear/> of Irish Jabbinet, so glossy<lb/>
               that now with not touching it, and who could<lb/>
               presume to touch <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HungX2">Mrs Hungerford's</persName> dress? could<lb/>
               believe it to be any thing but rich silk or satin.<lb/>
               This admired Jabbinet was presented by <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss E</persName>

               who has the honour to be descended from a branch<lb/>
               of that family. One other circumstance equally<lb/>
               deserved to be recorded, that whent he young Miss<lb/>

               on <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CrumJ1">Mr Jo<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> Crumpe</persName> to touch one because he <del>was</del> never<lb/>

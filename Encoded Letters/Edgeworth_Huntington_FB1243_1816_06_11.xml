            <p>I trust you will not<lb/>

               that your letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CrokT1">Croker</persName> were published-<lb/>

            <p>My dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName>
               <lb/>
               I am glad that I have received the copy<lb/>
               of your letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CrokT1">Croker</persName>, before my <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">fathers</persName>
               <lb/>
               return home, that I might have it in my<lb/>
               power to write to you, before I hear the opinions<lb/>
               of the higher Powers. I must <add>say</add> if you will<lb/>
               allow of your <unclear>servants</unclear> praise, that I think the<lb/>
               letter most clear, modest, yet manly and <choice>
                  <orig>dis-<lb/>
               interested</orig>
                  <reg>disinterested</reg>
               </choice>. And the arguments, for combining<lb/>
               the Coast with the interior survey of this kingdom,<lb/>
               unanswerable. And much as it thwarts my<lb/>
               interest or rather my ambition, yet I must <choice>
                  <orig>ac-<lb/>
                  -knowledge</orig>
                  <reg>acknowledge</reg>
               </choice> that the military surveyors, are the<lb/>
               proper body to be employed.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>However, I think if it was suggested to,<persName ref="./Personography.xml#MudgX1">
                  <unclear>Mudge</unclear>
               </persName>

          that two active companies might be formed<lb/>
               out of the present body, now employed in<lb/>
               <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#STK">Scotland</placeName>, that he or rather government, would<lb/>
               catch eagerly at the idea, for all they want<lb/>
               are situations in which they can place the <choice>
                  <orig>un-<lb/>
               employed</orig>
                  <reg>unemployed</reg>
               </choice> officers, without the appearance of<lb/>
               jobbing. And it is clear that an accurate<lb/>
               Survey of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName>, is called for on all sides<lb/>
               By the Admiralty, the military and by<lb/>
               the new grand Jury bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>As to instruments the expense of an entire<lb/>
               new set is a trifle compared to the expense<lb/>
               of the whole work, And in the next theodolite<lb/>
               they will improve upon the last.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>No time need be lost, for I am sure they have<lb/>
               instruments sufficient, for selecting their stations<lb/>
               and laying out the ground for their <hi rend="underline">base</hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="underline">lines</hi>. It is wonderful since <persName ref="./Personography.xml#RoyX1">Gen. Roy's time</persName>
               <lb/>
               and with all the experience that they have had,<lb/>
               if two men are not to be found under <persName ref="./Personography.xml#MudgX1">Mudge</persName>
               <lb/>
               Who are capable of carrying on separately, a<lb/>
               distinct survey. The <unclear>cumulation</unclear> that will<lb/>
               <pb n="3" facs="Edgeworth_Huntington_FB1243_1816_06_11_page03.jpg"/>              
              necessarily be exited will be advantageous to<lb/>
               both companies, and to the survey of the two<lb/>
               countries. Then we shall have a chance of their<lb/>
               attempting some improvements.<lb/>
               The <title ref="./Workography.xml#Janus1"> <choice><abbr>Ed.</abbr><reg>Edinburgh</reg></choice> <choice><orig>review</orig><reg>Review</reg></choice></title> will drive them to something new<lb/>
               in the Scotch mountains. I do not in this plan<lb/>
               look forward to being employed under this new<lb/>
               Corps, because without I was well paid it would<lb/>
               lead me entirely into one branch of my profession<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>This is what you said originally about my <del>being</del>
               <lb/>
               employment with you. And now I must<lb/>
               tell you that I am as little disappointed as<lb/>
               the <unclear/> of a <hi rend="underline">philosopher</hi> and not of a <hi rend="underline">Genius</hi>
               <lb/>
               ought to be. And the chief cause of any sorrow<lb/>
               that I may feel, is from my not being likely to<lb/>
                  see you, busy in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName>. I fear that I<lb/>
               shall be long enough tied here, from various<lb/>
                  disappointments, <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Roscommon_IE">Roscommon</placeName>
               <add>maps</add> can not be finished<lb/>
               for two years more. Most fortunately the three<lb/>
                  months that you <add>so promptly</add> allowed me, induced <persName ref="./Personography.xml#TaylX1">Major Taylor</persName>
               <lb/>
               to have my name put in the <choice><orig>Engineers</orig><reg>Engineer's</reg></choice> warrant<lb/>
               from the Post <choice><orig>Masters</orig><reg>Master's</reg></choice> General, for laying out two<lb/>
                  new lines of road chiefly thro' <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Roscommon_IE">Roscommon</placeName> and<lb/>
               <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Longford_IE">Longford</placeName>. This work, will not take up the whole<lb/>

              of the summer, and as the Engineer is paid<lb/>
               2 Gs. a mile, it will just support me till I<lb/>
                  have finished the drawing of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Roscommon_IE">Roscommon</placeName>. Can you<lb/>
               find out for me as <unclear>this</unclear> young drawer, who would look<lb/>
               forward like myself to good payment by his <choice>

               neat lines, I will give from 5 to 10 shillings a day.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now my dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName> let me thank you, and with just<lb/>
               The same feelings of Gratitude, as if we were first beginning<lb/>
               work together. Thank you for the Fatherly determination<lb/>
               with which you have managed my interests, and tho' I am<lb/>
               not to be employed, I am convinced, that the manner in<lb/>
               which you combined my employment, with yours, must<lb/>

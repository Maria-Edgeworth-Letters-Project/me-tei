            <p>Deep Dene
                Saturday Ap[superscript]l[/superscript] 17 [superscript]th[/superscript]
                1819.

                Deep [underline]Dene[/underline] -
                Dene a saxon word meaning
                a deep rift in a wood - in
                short a deep dingle -

                My dearest mother. Your wish that
                we should be at Deep Dene is accom-
                -plished. We are at last at this beautiful
                place in this sweet valley of Dorking. Not
                as we had last year hoped to be, with the
                great and good Sir Samuel Bonnelly but
                still we are with hospitable and kind
                people and in the midst of all the
                luxuries of life - and all that the gilding
                and painting, and bronzing of art can
                do within, and all that Nature can
                do with hill and vale, dingle and
                bushy wood to make the owners and
                their guests happy.

                The first evening of our arrival we
                were so late that even in driving thro'
                the vale of Dorking we were in an agony
                that prevented our enjoyment. We were
                cross because we were late. The Carrs who
                are enthusiasts about the beauties of
                the vale of Dorking & who know nothing
                of the Hopes but that he has built a great
                [insertion]new[/insertion] brick house and pulled down [deletion][unclear]a[/unclear][/deletion]
                some old house in Chert park which [unclear] very[/unclear]
                loved had spoken with sufficient in-
                -dignation of the manufactory looking
                [insertion]brick[/insertion] [/insertion] edifice which they say has set the valley
                on fire - At first sight the offices & the
                house all irregularly joined with [insertion]archways &[/insertion] cupola's
                and strangenesses of red [insertion]brick[/insertion] certainly did
                strike us as frightful in the midst of
                a most beautiful country - Our friend
                the housekeeper & several footmen standing
                at the arched door way watching in the dusk

                [page two begins]

                for our arrival, and the first words in
                answer to mine of " Is it dinner time? "
                " Yes Ma'am - dinner has been waiting
                this hour " - increased my uncomforta
                ble feelings - Fanny was so much tired
                that we determined she should not go to
                dinner especially as we heard that Con-
                versation Sharp and some other gentlemen
                were here. I had taken it for granted that
                the Hopes dined at the same hour in Town
                and country. But instead of 7 they dine
                at 6 [/unclear] in the country & various operations
                & leave takings & a visit to Lord - I mean
                to Lady Carrington had altogether detained
                us too late in Town - Fanny's health & the
                pity and interest which it and she ex-
                cited stood us in good stead. We dressed
                in the utmost hurry skurry in less than
                five minutes I am sure made our appear
                ance in the drawing where luckily the
                circle were standing & sitting by dim fire
                light & our guilty faces could scarcely
                be seen - From the midst two [insertion]black & white[/insertion] figures whom
                I knew to be M[superscript]r[/superscript]. & M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Hope each with hand
                extended came to meet us and with one
                comfortable pressure of each hand set the
                mind at ease. I descried by the wood
                fire light the wooden cut of M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Sharpe's
                face and was re-introduced to a M[superscript]r[/superscript]. [underline]Harness[/underline]
                whom you may remember tho' I did
                not - He told me he was introduced to us [underline]first[/underline]
                at Lydia Whyte's just after we had been pre-
                sented to the [underline]Duchess[/underline] [insertion][unclear]Qn[/unclear][/insertion] of Sussex. - He is an agreeable
                man & M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Sharpe was what they call (and
                I hate the expression) [underline]in great force[/underline] that day
                - And there was an admirable dinner
                of all manner of well disguised French
                dishes and creams & soufflés and ices

                [page three begins]

                and more than would have sufficed for the
                dinner of the first bon vivant in Town was
                se[unclear]n[/unclear]t by [insertion]the [/insertion]goodnatured M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hope[underline]s[/underline] to Fanny
                - As soon as I could steal away after dinner
                I got to her & found her as pale as a turnip
                wrapped in my shawl. After having swal
                lowed a little jelly she went to bed - A most
                comfortable [deletion]large [/deletion]French mattress - Canopy
                bed- large enough for four such as she
                & I - three rooms opening into one another
                - Small but superbly furnished - I was
                cross even with the fine furniture that
                night & regretted the dear Carrs & the
                the home comforts we found there.
                - I was shockingly afraid that Fanny
                was going to be ill again here - She had
                but little sleep in the night- and in the
                morning a new misery! Honora wakened
                with one of her sad sick headaches- Impos
                sible that either of them could think of get-
                ting up to break fast. But there was one
                comfort. M[superscript]r[/superscript]. and M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Hope [deletion]a[/deletion] breakfast in
                their own room. Only Miss Burrowes
                (M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Hopes niece) and M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Harness were at
                the breakfast table - This whole first day
                was uncomfortable as you may guess
                But this day all is[deletion] bright and[/deletion] well
                & bright and happy . Honora and Fanny
                are both refitted & we have had charm-
                ing walks & drives . Fanny first was
                taken out in [deletion]the [/deletion][insertion]a [/insertion]carriage & then had a
                little walk with M[superscript]r[/superscript] Hope and me -
                a beautiful walk through [underline]the [/underline]deep dene!
                -Larch & young beech just come out?.-
                & grass as green & fresh as Erin's - birds
                singing - lambs feeding & soft April air [insertion]every[/insertion]
                182

                [page four begins] 

                thing to delight Fanny going out for the
                first walk after her illness - she fixed on a
                beautiful place for a seat which M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Hope
                says he will have there & will call Fanny's
                seat. Nothing can be more courteously kind
                than M[superscript]r[/superscript]. and M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Hope are to us. I am very glad
                to see that her looks have improved much
                within this last fortnight & her spirits
                are better - But she has too little to do [deletion]and[/deletion]
                too many real good & fine things & too
                much time to think over painful recol-
                lections. Her living children are both fine
                boys and they will in time I hope re-ani-
                mate her.

                M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Hope keeps up in my mind the opinion
                I early formed - not of his taste, for I think
                his taste is the worst part of his mind, but
                of his information & general powers of
                conversation . In a very long tete a tete walk
                I had with him he gave me a history of the
                progress of architecture so perfectly clear
                that it might have been written down
                as he spoke it and your dear father & Louisa
                [insertion]w[superscript][/superscript]. [/insertion] have admired it and Leslie Foster with
                all his memory and all his accuracies
                could have found no fault. The most
                [underline]entertaining[/underline] part of the conversation how-
                ever was on persons not things. You may
                judge of the degree of [insertion]our [/insertion] intimacy when I
                tell you that M[superscript]r[/superscript]. H related to me the whole
                history of his love courtship & marriage
                and moreover of Miss Berry's courtship of him
                - disappointment - anger - and quarrel with
                M[superscript]rs[/superscript]. Hope - All which I must reserve for
                future fireside conversations - One [insertion]detached [/insertion] anecdote how
                ever I am afraid of forgetting & it is too good to forget
                When M[superscript]r[/superscript]. H was a young man & Capt[superscript]n[/superscript]. in the Mary
                bone volunteers he was at a city dinner, at his Colonels . a young
                lady sister to the lady of the house sat beside him at dinner
                - He was shy & she was shy & not a word passed between

                [page five begins]

                them during the first course but towards
                the end of the second the young lady as it
                is supposed feeling it incumbent upon her
                to do the honors of her sisters house & to say
                something to the young stranger & recollecting
                that he was just returned from his travels &

                is as kind as kind can be & I am sorry to rob her
                fraudulently & as it were underhand of the great
                pleasure I know she would have in being good
                to the boy & to your son; but I have my reasons
                for thinking that Tom is not the best companion
                for him and in Bath there would be danger of
                Francis being spoiled - Francis & M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Wilson seem
                to me both of them to understand how to treat
                a boy - If they go to Epping there is a work shop &
                employment out of doors - If they stay in Town

                taking him there will draw the acquaintance

                    I am desired by the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName> of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title> to
                    acknowledge, in his name, the honour you have done him by your most
                    flattering approbation of his work: <del>a</del> distinction which <add>he</add> receives as one
                    of the highest that could be paid him, and which he would have been
                    proud to have himself stated his sense of, only that being <hi rend="underline">impersonal</hi>,
                    he thought it more respectful to require my assistance, than to write
                    an anonymous letter.</p>
                <p> There are very few who have had the opportunities
                    that have been presented to me, of knowing how very elevated is the
                    admiration entertained by the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName> of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title>, for the genius of

                    while the work was going through my press, <hi rend="underline">I know</hi> that the
                    exquisite truth and power of your characters operated in his mind
                    at once to excite and subdue it. He felt that the success of his
                    book was to depend upon the character much more than upon the
                    book was to depend upon the characters much more than upon the

                    story; and he entertained so just and so high an opinion of your <choice><orig>emi-
                        nence</orig><reg>eminence</reg></choice> in the management of both, as to have strong apprehensions of
                    any comparison which might be initiated betwixt his pictures and story
                    &amp; yours; besides, that there is a richness and naivete in Irish character
                    <del>in which</del> and humour, in which the Scotch are certainly defective,
                    and which could hardly fail, as he thought, to render his delineations
                    cold and tame by the contrast. <quote>"If I could but hit <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth's</persName>
                    wonderful power of vivifying all her persons, and making them live
                    as rich beings in your mind, I should not be affraid."</quote> Often has
                    the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName> of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title> used such language to me: and I knew that
                    I gratified him most when I could say. <quote>"Positively, this <hi rend="underline">is</hi> equal
                        to Miss Edgeworth."</quote> You will thus judge, <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Madam</persName>, how deeply he

                <p> I believe he himself thinks the Baron the best
                    drawn character in his book - I mean the Baillie - honest Baillie
                    Macwheeble. He protests it is the most true, though from many
                    causes he did not expect it to be the most popular. It appears to
                    me, that amongst so many splendid portraits, all drawn with such
                    strength and truth, it is more <del></del> easy to say which is your
                    favourite than which is best. - <persName ref="./Personography.xml#MackH1">Mr. Henry Mackenzie</persName> agrees with
                    you in your objection to the resemblances to <persName ref=",/Personography.xml#FielH1">Fielding.</persName> He says,
                    you should never be forced to recollect, maugre all its internal evidence
                    to the contrary, that such a work is a work of fiction, and all
                    <hi rend="underline">its</hi>
                 <pb 3></pb>   
                    its fine creations but of air. The character of Rose is less finished than
                    the author had at one period intended; but I believe the characters of
                    humour grew upon his liking, to the prejudice, in some degree, of those of
                    a more elevated and sentimental kind. But what can surpass Flora
                    and her gallant brother!</p>
                    
                  <p>  I am not authorized to say, but I will not resist my
                      impulse to say to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth</persName>, that another novel, descriptive of
                      more ancient manners still, may be expected ere long from the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName>
                      of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title>. But I request him to observe, that I say this in strict
                    confidence - not, certainly, meaning to exclude from the knowledge of
                    what will give them pleasure, her respectable family.</p>
                    
                <p><persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Mr. Scott's</persName> poem, <title ref="./Workography.xml#Lordo1">The Lord of the Isles</title>, promises fully
                    to equal the most admired of his productions. It is, I think, equally
                    powerful, and certainly more uniformly polished &amp; sustained. I have
                    seen three Cantos. It will consist of six.

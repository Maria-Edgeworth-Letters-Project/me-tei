            <p>
                    I am desired by the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName> of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title> to<lb/>
                    acknowledge, in his name, the honour you have done him by your most<lb/>
                    flattering approbation of his work: <del>a</del> distinction which <add>he</add> receives as one<lb/>
                    of the highest that could be paid him, and which he would have been<lb/>
                    proud to have himself stated his sense of, only that being <hi rend="underline">impersonal</hi>,<lb/>
                    he thought it more respectful to require my assistance, than to write<lb/>
                    an anonymous letter.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> There are very few who have had the opportunities<lb/>
                    that have been presented to me, of knowing how very elevated is the<lb/>
                    admiration entertained by the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName> of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title>, for the genius of<lb/>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth.</persName>
               <del>During</del> From the intercourse that took place betwixt us<lb/>
                    while the work was going through my press, <hi rend="underline">I know</hi> that the<lb/>
                    exquisite truth and power of your characters operated in his mind<lb/>
                    at once to excite and subdue it. He felt that the success of his<lb/>
                    book was to depend upon the character much more than upon the<lb/>
                    story,<lb/>

                    story; and he entertained so just and so high an opinion of your <choice>

                        nence</orig>
                  <reg>eminence</reg>
               </choice> in the management of both, as to have strong apprehensions of<lb/>
                    any comparison which might be initiated betwixt his pictures and story<lb/>
                    &amp; yours; besides, that there is a richness and naivete in Irish character<lb/>
               <del>in which</del> and humour, in which the Scotch are certainly defective,<lb/>
                    and which could hardly fail, as he thought, to render his delineations<lb/>
                    cold and tame by the contrast. <quote>"If I could but hit <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth's</persName>

                        wonderful power of vivifying all her persons, and making them live<lb/>
                        as rich beings in your mind, I should not be affraid."</quote> Often has<lb/>
                    the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName> of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title> used such language to me: and I knew that<lb/>
                    I gratified him most when I could say. <quote>"Positively, this <hi rend="underline">is</hi> equal<lb/>
                        to Miss Edgeworth."</quote> You will thus judge, <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Madam</persName>, how deeply he<lb/>
                    must feel such praise as you have bestowed upon his efforts.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I believe he himself thinks the Baron the best<lb/>
                    drawn character in his book - I mean the Baillie - honest Baillie<lb/>
                    Macwheeble. He protests it is the most true, though from many<lb/>
                    causes he did not expect it to be the most popular. It appears to<lb/>
                    me, that amongst so many splendid portraits, all drawn with such<lb/>
                    strength and truth, it is more <del/> easy to say which is your<lb/>
                    favourite than which is best. - <persName ref="./Personography.xml#MackH1">Mr. Henry Mackenzie</persName> agrees with<lb/>
                    you in your objection to the resemblances to <persName ref=",/Personography.xml#FielH1">Fielding.</persName> He says,<lb/>
                    you should never be forced to recollect, maugre all its internal evidence<lb/>

                    its fine creations but of air. The character of Rose is less finished than<lb/>
                    the author had at one period intended; but I believe the characters of<lb/>
                    humour grew upon his liking, to the prejudice, in some degree, of those of<lb/>
                    a more elevated and sentimental kind. But what can surpass Flora<lb/>
                    and her gallant brother!<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  I am not authorized to say, but I will not resist my<lb/>
                    impulse to say to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Miss Edgeworth</persName>, that another novel, descriptive of<lb/>
                    more ancient manners still, may be expected ere long from the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Author</persName>
               <lb/>
                    of <title ref="./Workography.xml#Waver1">Waverley</title>. But I request him to observe, that I say this in strict<lb/>
                    confidence - not, certainly, meaning to exclude from the knowledge of<lb/>
                    what will give them pleasure, her respectable family.<lb/>

               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ScotW1">Mr. Scott's</persName> poem, <title ref="./Workography.xml#Lordo1">The Lord of the Isles</title>, promises fully<lb/>
                    to equal the most admired of his productions. It is, I think, equally<lb/>
                    powerful, and certainly more uniformly polished &amp; sustained. I have<lb/>

Dear Sir
I have just received yours
of the 20[superscript]th[/superscript]. inst - I am sorry
that the battery goes on so slowly
- my having followed this parsi
-monious plan has cost us both
monious plan has cost us both
much trouble -- At Bristol it
plagued me more than I chose
to complain of -
I know that I could have all
the types that are immediately
wanting for £5 & I
think if I can find a moments
[unclear]languor???[/unclear] & next week when I go
to Dublin to attend [unclear]Castl[superscript]l[/superscript][/unclear] that
I can have them cast & sent
to you to print Harry & Lucy
& Frank
Observe - Take Notice - NB -
[figure] I never said that I thought

Papas & Mamas would be at
the trouble to learn to teach I al-
ways feared they would not &
therefore I refused to be paid for
the Book till it had actually
succeeded - But I did & do say
that it is an excellent improve
-ment in the art of teaching to read
though I say it that sh[superscript]d[/superscript] not say it.
I feel so many qualms about
mixing new & old in the Parents
Assistant that I must beg - nay
insist that all the old [unclear]may??[/unclear]
[insertion]without any mixing of new[/insertion]
finish in the month [unclear][/unclear] March
[insertion]if you can put them all in March -[/insertion]
[insertion]or [unclear][/unclear] [unclear]fact[/unclear] of volumes if they will fill them[/insertion]
if the Barney [unclear][/unclear] is known
[unclear]aside[/unclear] we dont care - but we are
convinced that the Public [unclear]&c.[/unclear] will
be better pleased to have a
new series
Moral Tales being a new series
of the Parents Assistant
by Miss E &c. —
She has lately written two or

three beautiful things - some of
them dramatic for [deletion]Children[/deletion] [insertion]young people[/insertion]
One that I almost prefer to
Lazy Lawrence - If you are
good, & tractable about the arrange
-ment above mentioned you shall
have them!!! —
I understand that Lovell is to
offer you a translation of Berquins
Bibliotheque de village — the
original is excellent & I know that
the translators are fully equal to a
far more arduous task —
When you write please to
make your clerk send an account
of the Books sent to us since we
left England - for [insertion]all[/insertion] your accounts have
not reached us & we do not know
what Books we ought to have —
- N[superscript]o[/superscript]. 3 of one of the sets of Anderson is
wanting - please to put it
in your memorandum book -
[deletion]Please to send us to M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Dugdale bookseller[/deletion]
We [underline]desire[/underline] to have the vol of the
Bibliotheque Brittanique which
translates part of Prac Ed — we
want to correct our stile by seeing
its crookedness reflected in another language

Lovell wrote to us to say that he thought
[underline]Rivuletta[/underline] should not be thrown away
upon [underline]Early Lessons[/underline] that it should be kept
for a new Edition of Prac Ed - We agree with
him in this opinion & request you will
take out of [underline]Rosamond[/underline] the few pages which
[underline]relate[/underline] to it - they will leave no Hiatus —
We shall send for books in future by Dugdale
Copy to Johnson

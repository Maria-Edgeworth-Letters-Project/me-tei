               a highly interesting subject and I endeavoured<lb/>
               to excite her to put together all the hints she could<lb/>
               collect, and at some future time to tell us all that<lb/>
               can be done to ourselves and to our pupils, instead<lb/>
               of eternally repeating with <persName ref="./Personography.xml#LockJ2">Locke</persName> &amp; <persName ref="./Personography.xml#ReidT1">Reid</persName> and a hundred<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>How I am running on! <del>though</del> I only alluded<lb/>
               to the subject in order to add that I think I had<lb/>
               good reason to leave off in the same opinion that<lb/>
               I began - and at least to complain of my own<lb/>
               want of this valuable quality as on sitting down<lb/>
               now to write to you I cannot recollect whether<lb/>
               in the letter I dispatched to you from Trim I<lb/>
               entered into any description of my adventures<lb/>
               then amongst the decaying castles convents<lb/>
               and churches of former times. For fear however<lb/>
               of the "hateful twice told tale" I shall pass over<lb/>
               them (trusting to my poor memory to recall the<lb/>
               subject when I have the delight of returning<lb/>
               to your arms and to your ears) and proceed<lb/>
               with my onward journey. - Wednesday at<lb/>
               11 we started from <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Trim_IE">Trim</placeName> Vicarage, and, along with<lb/>

               her choice. Some cried <add>some smiled</add> - some were silent and<lb/>
               some talked in full exuberance of heart; - the meeting<lb/>
               was really affectingly pleasing. - The evening<lb/>

               <lb/>
               over the western hills, for much was yet to be done.<lb/>
               When dark an immense bonfire suddenly blazed<lb/>
               up in front of the house and gave the signal to<lb/>
               the whole population of the town who poured into<lb/>

               to feel "How is this to end?" - I therefore suggested<lb/>
               to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeL2">Lovell</persName> to stand up on the steps and thank<lb/>
               the multitude in <persName ref="./Personography.xml#SneyM1">Aunt Mary</persName>'s name. He took<lb/>

               from witnessing it - for she was too blind to enjoy the effort - but she heard<lb/>
               in the library frequent reports of what was doing -and she must have been<lb/>

               out - and the library was filled with 17 happy <del/> people who<lb/>
               again congratulated the excellent heroine of the day, and at length<lb/>
               allowed her to retire to a repose which the termination of a long journey<lb/>

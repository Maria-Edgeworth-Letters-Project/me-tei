               well as if you were with their side of me that<lb/>
               I have the warmest interest in all that<lb/>
               has happened and have been feeling<lb/>
               for you and with you - though I have not<lb/>

               - know all you have said - done - felt -<lb/>
               thought - and love you all the better -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               Now that the first tide of congratulations<lb/>
               have passed over, and that the overwhelming<lb/>
               truth has subsided you can have time for<lb/>
               mine - most sincere - most cordial they<lb/>
               are-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               All things considered - and balanced<lb/>
               I can honestly tell you that I do believe you will<lb/>
               be as happy in a palace as you <del>were</del> have been<lb/>
               in the observatory - more I cannot say - and<lb/>
               you will feel that this is saying quite enough<lb/>
               - I wish ... (<persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinJ1">Doctor Brinkley's</persName>) I was going to say<lb/>
               I mean the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrinJ1">Bishop of Cloyne's</persName> parting with<lb/>
               his instrument were well over - and your<lb/>
               parting with your daughter - you can neither<lb/>
               of you bear to hear me mention these things - but<lb/>
               I am doing you a service - It is surprising how<lb/>

               the mind learns to submit to necessity - and when<lb/>
               we have heard and said to ourselves repeatedly<lb/>
               that any anything must be the <hi rend="underline">must be</hi> at last becomes<lb/>

            <p> You do me too much honour in supposing
                    me so deeply and personally interested in the
                    republication of the novels in question - Not so
                    the rest of your letter which gives me the agreeable
                    assurance that you &amp; the young ladies your sisters
                    are to visit <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#STK">Scotland</placeName> early in May &amp; will honor
                    <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Abbotsfsord-House_STK">Abbotsford</placeName> (never more honored) in the first weeks
                    of that month. Remember however this is only
                    your first visit otherwise we shall be strangely
                    defrauded as I must be in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Edinburgh_STK">Edinburgh</placeName> on the
                    12[<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. when our Courts resume their sittings So I
                    <unclear/> know if we can combine to <unclear>when</unclear> Abbots
                    <unclear/> of <unclear/>
                    You will find me like a King (every busied with
                    pulling down &amp; building up - there is however enough
                    of lodging such as it is having an actual roof
                    on it for I had the sense to build half of my
                    
                    house before I pulled the rest down so we shall
                    be well enough though amid lime and dust &amp;
                    <unclear/> good <unclear>here</unclear>.

                    their natural gifts - Both are naturally shrewd
                    &amp; sensible &amp; the elder has a sort of quiet and
                    sincere enthusiasm about her own country which

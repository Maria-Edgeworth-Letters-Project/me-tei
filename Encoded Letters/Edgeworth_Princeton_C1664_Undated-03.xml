            <p><!--     LJ NOTE PAUSED HERE 12/2/23
               You ask whether we or
you should mention the price
of the copy-right of the 4[superscript]th[/superscript], 5[superscript]th[/superscript] & 6[superscript]th[/superscript]
volumes of Tales of Fash. Life
I can assure you that neither
Maria nor I had or have
formed any opinion upon the
subject nor, do I think, that you
can form a safe: judgement
for some time - Maria's
name was popular & there-
fore there was an early run
for her new publications
Whether, that popularity may
or may not be diminished

by her present work, cannot
I should think, be as yet de-
termined - At all events
you may be assured that we
have the most unbounded
confidence in your justice
& in your honor and that we
shall never name any price
for any thing we send to you
It will entertain you to
hear that Maria has been re-
proached by some folk
hear for having endeavoured
to [underline]lower[/underline] the Irish character
I have much more reason
to fear that the English mi

litia should think themselves
aggrieved, or that London
cockneys & Long Acre should
rage against us - or perhaps
the higher frozen circles
In all such misfortunes
we keep silence &
depend upon time "the
comforter -
The idea of Lord Moira's
being like [unclear]??vian[/unclear] is quite
absurd - Lord Moira is cer-
tainly a man most [unclear]firm[/unclear]
of purpose -
As for Lady Clonbrony, there
are so many & so many
alike, that each will cry
this [unclear]sister[/unclear] is levelled at you -

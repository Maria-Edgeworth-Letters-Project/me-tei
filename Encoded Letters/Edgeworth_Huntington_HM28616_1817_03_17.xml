               between her and <unclear>her riffle </unclear>- protected her from ill<lb/>
               usage and returned her everything she asked for<lb/>
               - All his kindness to her his counsel made<lb/>
               her state in a most amusing cross examination<lb/>
               and so great was the injunction of the jury and<lb/>

               and avarice, as the prosecution was evidently<lb/>
               excited by the hopes of reward on conviction, - and<lb/>
               so remarkable was <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CollX1">Collier</persName>'s character for generosity<lb/>
               and humanity as he had never done a single<lb/>
               cruel action and had given away large sums<lb/>
               to the poor that in defiance of the clearest<lb/>
               evidence he <hi rend="underline">was actually acquitted</hi> ! - He<lb/>
               will not however be sent to try his hand again<lb/>
               on the high road as there is another charge against<lb/>

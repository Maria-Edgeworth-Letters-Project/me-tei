bridge. In truth he is a most extraordinary<lb/>

from a very sensible woman in America <unclear>expressing</unclear>
<del>the </del>her admiration of the works and containing
some excellent observations - but gently <unclear>reporting</unclear>
her with having in no instance mentioned a
Jew without branding him with all the common-
-place acrimony of vulgar writers - "Yet" says
the fair Israelite writer "can it be believed that
this race of men are by Nature mean avaricious
and unprincipled? - Forbid it Mercy! <del></del>
In those parts of the world where the people

- &amp; when character and talents are sufficient
to attain advancement <unclear>in kind</unclear> the Jews form
a respectable part of the community. They
are as liberal and well educated as others -
they follow the honourable <unclear>professions</unclear> of the
Law, Physick &amp;c with credit and ability, and
associate with the best society. Friendships
and attachments are formed with <unclear>thou</unclear> of
different persuasions from their own, and each
looks on the variations of the other as things of
course - as differences which necessarily take
place in every society." - And much more
in another letter - In consequence Maria
has composed a story on purpose to place
a Jew in a more favourable point of view.
Madame de Staël's new work will possibly

effects de la Revolution Francaise" - The <del>English</del>
French <unclear>recollection</unclear> is a threadbare subject in this
country - but there is an episode which will
stimulate the curiosity of a large portion
of readers - "L'Angleterre" - So rarely have
philosophers deigned to travel in England, (and
of those none of any note have published their
observations <add>unless Pillote &amp;e.</add>) -) that it will be very interesting

"Le portrait aurait ete plus resemblant de

amused by reading his lordship's journal thro'
Switzerland in which <add>are</add> many detached <add>ex</add>pressions
characteristic of the poet and of the man. - Among
them is a curious description of a great cascade
900 feet high that <unclear>carves</unclear> in falling over a rock:
- he says its shape is like "the Tail of a white
horse streaming in the wind, such as might
be <unclear>conceived</unclear> would be that of the <hi rend="underline">Pale Horse </hi>
on which Death is mounted in the Apocalypse
neither mist nor water but something between
both, wonderful &amp; indescribable." One of the
Glaciers he called a frozen hurricane. He quits
the mountains with regret, and says "my journal

from Thum to Berne we had good roads, good
houses, property and all the commonplace
tokens of insipid civilization.

efforts made in his late poems to detract the
affections of the son from his mother as he

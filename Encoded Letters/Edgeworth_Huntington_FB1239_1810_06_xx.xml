               I have not told you yet how greatly M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>Edgeworth was<lb/>
               delighted with your independant refusal to <hi rend="underline">ax</hi> a<lb/>

               again to <hi rend="underline">pay court</hi> to any one so dont be afraid - and Ill<lb/>
               tell you my reason why - Because I find you get on better<lb/>
               without it. - I would send you a copy of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Croker's very hand<lb/>
               some letter if I did not believe that Louisa had already done<lb/>
               so - but I will conclude with his words "I never happened to <del/><add>hear</add> -<lb/>
               of a gentleman so generally and so highly commended as he is -<lb/>

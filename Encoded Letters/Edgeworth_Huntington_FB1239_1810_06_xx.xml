                <p>There are no reasonable bounds
                    to my joy and exultation - that
                    you should be promoted was
                    your right as an officer, that
                    you should be promoted insuch
                    an distinguished manner is
                    due to your real unobtrusive
                    merit; which I have always
                    known how to appreciate and
                    which I sincerely rely on for your
                    Future advancement above
                    your fellow's - I take some
                    subordinate pleasure in being
                    conscious that I always
                    foretold what has now <choice><orig>hap-

                    -rise</orig><reg>arise</reg></choice> merely from my being of
                    a sanguine temper but from
                    the exertion of some of those
                    prophetic powers that are
                    attained by old experience -
                    To morrow is my 66 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. birth

                    heart, but she dare not say so,
                    wishes that your letter had come
                    a day later. Indeed I do not
                    think that your sisters felt more
                    pleasure at hearing <add>of</add>your <choice><orig>promo
                    -tion</orig><reg>promotion</reg></choice>than she did -
                    I have the remainder of the
                    sheet to the congratulations of
                    some of the most warm hearted
                    ladies I have ever known of
                    whom <persName ref="./Personography.xml#SneyM1">Mary Sneyds</persName> is not the
                    coldest. - </p>
                    
                 <p>We do indeed my dearest brother most <choice><orig>unanimous
                     -ly</orig><reg>unanimously</reg></choice> rejoice that you are likely to be so soon placed in
                    the situation where you ought long ago to have been
                    placed, both from the exertions of your body and the
                    powers of your mind; and that it has been done
                    in such a manner as to satisfy even your own
                    proud heart - and proud enough God knows you are
                    I have not told you yet how greatly M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>Edgeworth was
                    delighted with your independant refusal to <hi rend="underline">ax</hi> a
                    peer for anything but an axe. I never will ask you
                    again to <hi rend="underline">pay court</hi> to any one so dont be afraid - and Ill
                    tell you my reason why - Because I find you get on better
                    without it. - I would send you a copy of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Croker's very hand
                    some letter if I did not believe that Louisa had already done
                    so - but I will conclude with his words "I never happened to <del></del> <add>hear</add> -
                    of a gentleman so generally and so highly commended as he is -
                    May God preserve your life both for your country &amp; your friends

             <p>    To tell you my most dear brother that my heart is rejoiced
                    at your certainty of promotion would be to tell you what
                    you know; I can only say that you have my warmest
                    congratulations, &amp; wishes, that your promotion may be
                    a source of happiness to you, &amp; that you may continue

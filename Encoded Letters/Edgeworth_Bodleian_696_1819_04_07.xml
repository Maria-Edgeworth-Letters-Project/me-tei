                She has had two blisters
                one on her chest one on
                her side for that vile pain
                in her side. She has taken

                state - no fever remains
                - but very little pain in her
                side - nothing but weak

                that it was hurtful to press
                her to eat till she wished
                it - I enclose <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HollP1">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hollands</persName>
                note of this morning - he
                insists you see on her being
                kept from all that can
                agitate her. I fairly told him
                her mind had been kept
                in a harrassing state.
                Armed with his medical
                orders I shall insist on
                no person's seeing her till

                That is impossible - I will

                then I will insist upon

               Postscripts do NOT go inside closer tags. Adjust to take into account the order in your letter. 
               Sometimes the signature is on page three, the address on page four, then the postscript follows back on the top of page one, for example.-->
            <closer><!--Use the <closer> element again to hold Address Leaf information.-->
               <address>
                  <!--Include any text written on the address leaf; use a separate "addrLine" for each line and indicate line breaks. -->
                  <addrLine/>
                  <addrLine/>
                  <addrLine/>
               </address>
            </closer>
         </div>
      </body>
      <back> </back>
   </text>

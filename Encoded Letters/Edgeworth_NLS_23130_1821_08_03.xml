               I am equally grateful and surprized at your <unclear/>

               all about the <hi rend="underline">bar paper</hi> letter which has thus strangely fallen<lb/>
               into your hands and which I should have thought as awkward<lb/>
               <unclear>sishay</unclear> as possible to all but the writer and the young person to<lb/>
               whence it was addressed. I suppose my young <unclear>nephew</unclear> had given<lb/>
               it to some person who was found as is not uncommon of collecting<lb/>
               the parings of the nails of literary liens. He is just now on duty<lb/>
               at a place called <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Cappoquin_IE">Cappoquin</placeName> and has had the bad fortune to<lb/>

               <add>kind</add> of warfare - As for my<lb/>
               manuscript all there can be said of it is that it was ever<lb/>

               to say his hand <hi rend="underline">has been</hi> a fine one for the writers most<lb/>

               I am just returned from <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> where I had the<lb/>
               curiosity to go for the Coronation which was really a<lb/>
               pageant worth going a great way to see. I did not think<lb/>

               returned to my own humble residence to think over all this<lb/>
               magnificence during my own solitary rides over hill and<lb/>
               dale "between the thorn and the sloe" as our old songs have it.<lb/>
               My welch <unclear>Handcart</unclear> has returned not much cured of his concern<lb/>
               but with a good deal more to be conceited of as I am pleased<lb/>
               with the progress he has made in his studies. He goes back<lb/>
               after the holidays - I beg my most respectful compliments<lb/>

               after having so well discharged the pious duty <unclear>in flow</unclear> in<lb/>

               you for the valued present of a copy but that which is not<lb/>
               done when it ought to be done at all as no one knows<lb/>

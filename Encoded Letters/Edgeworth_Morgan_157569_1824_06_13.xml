               succeeds to disappointed exertion have been too often<lb/>
               seen in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE"/>Ireland - The failure of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BrooR1">Brooke of <hi rend="underline">Prosperous</hi>
               </persName>
               <lb/>
               - the failure of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#AndeJ1">Anderson of Fermoy</persName> - were much<lb/>
               greater misfortunes to <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE"/>Ireland than the failure of<lb/>
               <add>
                  <unclear/>
               </add>two individuals could have been in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK"/>England -<lb/>
               Because the impression left on the public mind was<lb/>
               "See how vain it is for public spirited people to lay<lb/>
               "out their money in manufactures or great establish<lb/>

               If the Irish <add>speculators</add> could but be taught to look before they leap!<lb/>
               You English certainly do look well before they leap<lb/>
               - therefore they leap safely - The Scotch look too long<lb/>
               before they leap - <lb/>
               I am not sure whether I have written to you since<lb/>

               what private letters from <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK"/>London hint I began to fear there<lb/>

               by the transaction - how can that be when he has sacrificed Ã‚Â£2000<lb/>

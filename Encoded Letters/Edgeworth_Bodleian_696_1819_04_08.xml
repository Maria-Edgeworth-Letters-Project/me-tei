                    out &amp; now I hope she will gain strength
                    gradually. Her uncle <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName> has several

                    the stipulation that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#WilsL2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> L W</persName> should not
                    come. Till she is quite recovered I will
                    not permit <add>him to have a glimpse of her</add> - see what a dragon of a duenna
                    I am grown. How Fear does give courage -
                    My fear of <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny's</persName> health has made me
                    bold as a lioness guarding her cubs.</p>
            <p>Now that she assures me that no
                    love lurks at the heart I require that the
                    next meeting should be the last. She has
                    in fact decided &amp; <add>to</add> what purpose further
                    meetings except to wear her out with pity
                    &amp; to make the final disappointment
                    more painful to him. <hi rend="underline">More</hi>painful
                    as it must be - the more he sees of her
                    delightfully amiable disposition.</p>
            <p> I decide therefore that if her health
                    permit we take our farewell breakfast or
                    luncheon at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Harley-Street_ENK">Harley Street</placeName> on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or
                    15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>go to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#WhitE1">Lady E W</persName> who desired to see us
                    again when the business should be decided
                    and not till then - stay with her till the
                 <pb n="3" facs="Edgeworth_Bodleian_696_1819_04_08_page03.jpg"/>   
                    17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. &amp; that day go to the Hopes at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Deep-Dene-Dorking_ENK">Deep Dene</placeName>
                    &amp; stay till the first week in May when
                    Lord Carrington has asked us to <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#High-Wycombe_ENK">High Wycombe</placeName>
                    on our way back to <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Byrkley-Lodge_ENK">Byrkley Lodge</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>I find that there is a possibility of getting
                     by a [<unclear>cross</unclear>road from <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Dorking_ENK">Dorking</placeName> to <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#High-Wycombe_ENK">High Wycombe</placeName>
                    &amp; without returning to Town. Therefore
                    as far as I see at present this is our best
                    plan to <hi rend="underline">cut &amp; run</hi> as soon as possible &amp;
                    get <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> out of the way of torturing or
                    being tortured. Perhaps I said all this
                    to you before but I cannot in the least
                    recollect what I wrote two days ago &amp; it
                    is better to tire you with repetition or
                    even to bewilder you with <choice>

                  <reg>contradictions</reg>
               </choice> than to leave you in ignorance <unclear>or</unclear>
                    in doubt of my intentions <add>at least</add> as fast as I form
                    them -</p>
            <p>All I said in my last about a draft of mine
                    to pay Newingtons bill <unclear>efface</unclear> from your
                    memory - all a mistake. <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName> says he
                    has money on that account and has torn
                    my draft -</p>

               viz "that no translation from the Original Hebrew<lb/>

               - This is tantamount to a complete translation - &amp; you<lb/>
               cannot call this consecrating error - They might err &amp;<lb/>

               - &amp; you will say is it not right to hear compare &amp;<lb/>
               judge? - Yes if I could judge or compare after I<lb/>

               with <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">my father</persName> - No change has taken place<lb/>

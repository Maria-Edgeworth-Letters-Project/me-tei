                 except to point out that I from time <add>to time</add> told you<lb/>
                 the manuscript would be shortly sent to you<lb/>
                 And that I distinctly told you that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Maria</persName> had<lb/>
                 written 1200 pages in three months. Could it be<lb/>
                 supposed she worked so hard, deprived herself<lb/>
                 of all amusement and hazarded her health<lb/>
                 for the purpose of having a manuscript in <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BriaX1">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>We are however perfectly satisfied that this<lb/>
                 was only a dull misapprehension on your<lb/>
                 part and that you did not mean to treat<lb/>
               <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeM1">Maria</persName> as a hireling. We entirely accede<lb/>
                 to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Captain Beauforts</persName> arrangements -viz - that<lb/>
                 the printer shall work double tides. Indeed it<lb/>

            <p>I shall now answer your former letter<lb/>
                 relative to our money transactions.<lb/>
                 In the first place I reiterate for the third time <add>my </add>

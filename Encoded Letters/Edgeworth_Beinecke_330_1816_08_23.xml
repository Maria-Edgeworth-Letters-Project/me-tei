               I am that I have neglected the advantage &amp; the honour of that<lb/>

               its fullest extent. What an excellent &amp; what a cruel piece is your<lb/>

               activity &amp; strength of mind must have hindered you from partaking<lb/>
               I cannot imagine, but to me it has given many a twinge of<lb/>
               conscience, &amp; most particularly in the affair of letter writing which, if<lb/>
               I have happenned to delay a little too long, always becomes difficult to me<lb/>
               beyond imagination. Days pass, &amp; the more honour &amp; esteem I have for my<lb/>
               correspondent, the more I feel that I have nothing worth communicating<lb/>
               &amp; my brain feels dry, - "<hi rend="underline">as the remaining biscuit</hi> -<lb/>
               <hi rend="underline">after a voyage</hi>". With regard to yourself, tho longing to write, I<lb/>

               acknowledgements I owe you, both in common with all those who have<lb/>
               been delighted &amp; instructed by your charming works, &amp; more particularly<lb/>
               as having received them from your hands. Long may you continue<lb/>

                  is like a youth without affections, there is nothing to cheer the damp<lb/>

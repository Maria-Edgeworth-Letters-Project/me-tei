                  My dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">friend</persName>,<lb/>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>It is long since I have felt so much<lb/>
               satisfaction as I felt this morning<lb/>
               from your letter. Both <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Edgeworth</persName>
               <lb/>
               <add>my aunts</add> and I thought we might feel sure<lb/>
               <del>that</del> of what your opinion would<lb/>
               be, but to have that opinion so fully<lb/>
               and clearly expressed, to see the<lb/>
               reasons by which it is supported<lb/>
               so ably stated &amp; to feel at once that<lb/>
               they are perfectly solid and that<lb/>
               they entirely coincide with my own<lb/>
               is highly satisfactory <del>to me</del> - I told<lb/>
               you truly, that I was conscious that<lb/>
               I should not have been able to act<lb/>
               in consequence of your opinion<lb/>
               had it been contrary to my own<lb/>
               - that no power but that which can<lb/>
               never more be exerted over my mind<lb/>
               could even if I were convinced it<lb/>
               were right &amp; necessary <del/> excite<lb/>
               me at this time to such an attempt<lb/>
               - But the more I felt that your opinion<lb/>
               <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_Huntington_HM28598_1817_08_01_page02.jpg"/>
               
               had it been on the other side of the question<lb/>
               would have been inadequate to rouse<lb/>
               me to exertion above my <del/> powers<lb/>
               the more I felt anxious that such<lb/>
               should not be the opinion of the<lb/>
               friend whose judgment I know <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeR1">my<lb/>
               dear father</persName> valued above that of any<lb/>
               other of his friends and upon whose<lb/>

                  <reg>memory</reg>
               </choice> he relied more than upon<lb/>
               those of any other man living - <choice>

               I thank you particularly for stating<lb/>
               all your reasons distinctly as <hi rend="underline">your</hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi rend="underline">own</hi>, without reference to my sentiments.<lb/>
               - I shall have to consult you probably<lb/>
               hereafter on many points - <del>and</del> so<lb/>
               once for all, be assured that you can<lb/>
               never speak the truth to me too flatly<lb/>
               or too strongly - Consider I have been<lb/>
               used to it - and used to feel it the surest<lb/>
               proof of friendship -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>You have relieved me from all<lb/>
               remaining <del>fear</del>
               <add>scruple</add> of dis-obeying that<lb/>
               <hi rend="underline">injunction</hi> with which I never <hi rend="underline">promised </hi>
               <lb/>
               to comply - which it was dreadful to me<lb/>
               to hear- and <hi rend="underline">to</hi>
               <hi rend="underline">recollect</hi> - still more dreadful.<lb/>
               - I am glad that you coolly &amp; at a distance<lb/>
               agree with <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. E</persName> and me that it was a feverish<lb/>

               <pb n="3" facs="Edgeworth_Huntington_HM28598_1817_08_01_page03.jpg"/>
               
               which dictated that letter to <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HuntX1">Hunter</persName> - How<lb/>
               I rejoice that I did not send it - and<lb/>
               yet at the time I feared I was doing wrong<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But as you say dear <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauF1">Francis</persName> I<lb/>
               must not ever more permit myself to<lb/>
               think of that injunction - I must emulate<lb/>
               "<hi rend="underline">his</hi> strength of resolution which rejected<lb/>
               "all minor views incompatible with<lb/>
               "a great object. - How kind of you to say<lb/>
               that "Could he now look down upon<lb/>
               "the struggles of my heart he would<lb/>
               "cheer me on &amp; encourage me to do that<lb/>
               "which in my conscience I judge most fit"<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It seems as if you had looked<lb/>
               straight to the bottom of my heart for<lb/>
               this is the idea the question that<lb/>
               perpetually reccurs to me<lb/>
               "If he could look down upon<lb/>
               "me - could see me now what would<lb/>
               "he think - would he approve or <choice>

               On the question touched upon in the<lb/>
               conclusion of your letter - should the<lb/>
               <title ref="./Workography.xml#Memoi1">Memoirs</title> be in his own person &amp; as<lb/>
               written by him? - I differ from you- - But<lb/>
               we shall have time &amp; time enough to<lb/>
               discuss this hereafter - we differ only<lb/>

               had the courage to <del>read</del> open it till two days<lb/>
               ago when I felt the propriety the necessity<lb/>

               with ours - as far as we have gone -<lb/>

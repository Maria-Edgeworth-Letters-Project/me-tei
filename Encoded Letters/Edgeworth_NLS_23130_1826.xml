            <p>My correspondence has been interrupted first by my

                    death of my Nephew <persName ref="./Personography.xml#HuxlC1">Colonel Huxley</persName> of the 71<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> whom I expected from

                    child have been deprived by the sudden &amp; shocking accident of his death
                    on the eve of departing from <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Halifax_ENK">Halifax</placeName>. He was a brave soldier regular in
                    all his habits attached to his <del/>wife &amp; family and maintaining <choice>

                    late enlarged by a bequest to my sister in law from her late brother
                    <persName ref="./Personography.xml#MacCD1">David Macculloch</persName> to the amount sum of £10,000 which established the
                    whole family in complete independence - and now when they expected
                    him to come over here and he had to <unclear>taken</unclear> his passage - when I had seen
                    his wife at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Clullin-Cheltenham_ENK">Clullin Cheltenham</placeName> in all the happiness of expectation comes
                    this fatal intelligence. The distress of of course has been immense and
                    I own I have been my self much shocked at the loss of a brave soldier
                    which all admitted him to be and at the same time a much gentle
                    obliging friendly man in this unexpected and such disastrous
                    manner. It has really put me out of sorts in the body as well as
                    the mind or perhaps the extraordinary open state of the state
                    has given me an unusual stance of the stomach complaints &amp;
                    rheumatics that are going about. Yesterday on arriving here I had
                    to be lifted out of the carriage so compleatly were my joints
                    disabled by the rheumatism. But the hot bath &amp; <del>opost</del> opodeledic

                    supply the plan of the exhausted Cruett. It is rather a hard choice for

            <p>I wish that I could write to you my dear<lb/>
                    Madam in your own delightful language<lb/>
                    which expresses in such a melodious, <choice>

                    never convey to you - unless indeed you<lb/>
                    are so kind to translate me into Italian<lb/>
                    as you read - And certainly this would<lb/>

                    and facility that I can scarcely help think<lb/>

                    you have done me - I hope you are an author?<lb/>

                    Miss Smith with whom I understand<lb/>
                    you are well acquainted informs me that<lb/>
               you were for some time in <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#London_ENK">London</placeName> - I am sorry<lb/>
                    I was not there at that time as it would have<lb/>
                    gratified me to have made your acquaintance<lb/>
                    - If you should ever return to <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName> I flatter<lb/>

                    my thanks to you in person - and of enjoying as much<lb/>
                    of your company as you could afford me -<lb/>
                    It is scarcely to be hoped that you should think<lb/>
                    of a visit to <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName>? Foreigners I fear have<lb/>
                    a terrible idea of this country and imagine<lb/>
                    that they could not live a day or sleep a<lb/>
                    night here in peace - But believe me this is<lb/>
                    a false notion; I have lived here <add>almost</add> all my life -<lb/>
                    a life of upwards of 60 years ; and have had<lb/>
                    no reason to complain, but much reason to<lb/>
                    love and pity my countrymen - The reasons<lb/>
                    for pity have been, Thank God! every year<lb/>
                    diminishing - the last year most - <lb/>
                    now that religious and civil liberty <unclear>have</unclear>
               <lb/>
                    been added to the blessings of a fertile soil of<lb/>
                    warm hearts, good heads &amp; ingenious<lb/>

                    expect the Irish will rise in the scale of <choice>

                    security &amp; peace are established here, I count on<lb/>

                    then hope that La Signora Majone will some<lb/>
                    time be of that number? perhaps not while<lb/>

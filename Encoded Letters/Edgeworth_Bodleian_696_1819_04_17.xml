                place in this sweet valley of <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Dorking_ENK">Dorking</placeName>. Not<lb/>
                as we had last year hoped to be, with the<lb/>
                great and good <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BonnS1">Sir Samuel Bonnelly</persName> but<lb/>
                still we are with hospitable and kind<lb/>
                people and in the midst of all the<lb/>
                luxuries of life - and all that the gilding<lb/>
                and painting, and bronzing of art can<lb/>
                do within, and all that Nature can<lb/>
                do with hill and vale, dingle and<lb/>
                bushy wood to make the owners and<lb/>
                their guests happy. <lb/></p>

            <p> The first evening of our arrival we<lb/>
                were so late that even in driving thro'<lb/>

                that prevented our enjoyment. We were<lb/>
                cross because we were late. The <persName ref="./Personography.xml#CarrX1">Carrs</persName> who<lb/>

                and strangenesses of red <add>brick</add> certainly did<lb/>
                strike us as frightful in the midst of<lb/>
                a most beautiful country - Our friend<lb/>
                the housekeeper &amp; several footmen standing<lb/>

                for our arrival, and the first words in<lb/>
                answer to mine of " Is it dinner time? "<lb/>
                " Yes Ma'am - dinner has been waiting<lb/>

                that we determined she should not go to<lb/>
                dinner especially as we heard that <persName ref="./Personography.xml#SharR1"><choice><orig>Con-<lb/>

                and country. But instead of 7 they dine<lb/>

                in the utmost hurry skurry in less than<lb/>
                five minutes I am sure made our appear<lb/>
                ance in the drawing where luckily the<lb/>
                circle were standing &amp; sitting by dim fire<lb/>
                light &amp; our guilty faces could scarcely<lb/>
                be seen - From the midst two <add>black &amp; white</add> figures whom<lb/>

                comfortable pressure of each hand set the<lb/>
                mind at ease. I descried by the wood<lb/>

                - And there was an admirable dinner<lb/>

                - As soon as I could steal away after dinner<lb/>
                I got to her &amp; found her as pale as a turnip<lb/>
                wrapped in my shawl. After having swal<lb/>

                bed- large enough for four such as she<lb/>

                was going to be ill again here - She had<lb/>
                but little sleep in the night- and in the<lb/>
                morning a new misery! <persName ref="./Personography.xml#BeauH1">Honora</persName> wakened<lb/>

                I have full instructions from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Holland respect-
                ing every particular about her health. He says
                that for 2 or 3 years till it becomes regularly good
                her health will require care - but <hi rend="underline">with</hi> care he

                [Now I am between two fears - Fear the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. that you

                (ease by telling you the simple truth. I found it very
                (difficult to make him take a fee the first day -
                (but did - one guinea - I never repeated the attempt till
                (the last moment at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. <add>J</add> Baillies - He eluded me

                (You wish that I should let you know when we

                If you will permit me to give you
                my unasked advice about little Francis's <add>5 weeks,</add> Whit
                suntide holidays I should advise his staying with
                his uncle Francis &amp; his friends in Harley Street
                instead of going with the Beddoes to Bath. Anna
                is as kind as kind can be &amp; I am sorry to rob her
                fraudulently &amp; as it were underhand of the great
                pleasure I know she would have in being good
                to the boy &amp; to your son; but I have my reasons
                for thinking that Tom is not the best companion
                for him and in Bath there would be danger of
                Francis being spoiled - Francis &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wilson seem
                to me both of them to understand how to treat
                a boy - If they go to Epping there is a work shop &amp;
                employment out of doors - If they stay in Town
                They will take Francis frequently to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carrs
                - Joanna Bailie's &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Colebrooks at Hampstead
                - The Carrs in particular <add>are </add><del>an </del>admirable <add>literary </add>acquaintance

                for him - Colebrook's scientific - and Joanna <add>&amp; Agnes </add> Bail
                lie all that is good &amp; motherly - and all these
                people judiciously fond of the boy - And all
                have cordially invited him - And the object of
                taking him there will draw the acquaintance
                between our Hampstead &amp; Harley Street friends
                necessarily closer together - an advantage to all
                parties concerned - Now dear mother give
                me a decided answer as soon as you can
                say whether you chuse that he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. go to Bath or
                to Capt<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. B - for Whitsuntide is a-coming

                He goes to the Carrs &amp; Baillies on the
                22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. for the 3 days Easter Holidays - I told M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>.
                Marcet you would give him some leave to go to see
                her. She asked leave <add>very humbly</add> to send for him some Saturday
                - I asked D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M to shew him his model of a steam
                engine <del>next</del> <del>next</del><add>this</add> Sunday &amp; have settled that his uncle
                <del>will</del> takes him there . I believe I told you in my last
                that excellent answer F<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. made to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Carr about
                the steam engine - If I did not say so - for it is
                but just you sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. know how <add>sensible &amp; how</add> modest that dear boy
                is - M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hope runs up to Town tomorrow &amp; down next day &amp;
                We shall stay here till next saturday morning
                the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. when we shall go to Lady E. Whitbread -
                I enclose a note from Lady Harrowby - shall
                accept her offer and if <persName ref="./Personography.xml#EdgeF3">Fanny</persName> is stout as a lion
                she shall go with me for it was for her chiefly
                I <del>mana</del> begged the favor &amp; I would not take
                the trouble of going without her -
                When we are again with Lady E W you
                know she has promised me to have <del>her brother</del>
                Lord Gray that we may introduce little Francis
                to him. I particularly wish this because Lord G
                is excessively fond of his own sons who are fine
                clever boys &amp; therefore he will <hi rend="underline">take</hi> to Francis &amp;
                once in Francis will never be out of his head &amp;
                heart - Besides I wish for Francis to become
                acquainted with the Gray boys - (not Gray Beards)
                - They will be right good companions for him
                when he visits Lady EW W - instead of the Battys who

                tho good are vulgar<hi rend="underline">ish</hi> &amp; worship him too much
                Too Besides I know old good Lady Gray will
                hug him to her breast (bone) when she knows
                him &amp; all the Gray children cluster &amp; cling
                round that Eldest of Forms

                Your commissions are all executed &amp;
                I have bought 30 yards of Canvas (Italian

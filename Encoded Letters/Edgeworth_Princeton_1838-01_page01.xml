               it will give you pleasure to see that your introductions<lb/>
               "have done me Yeoman's service" - as <title ref="./Workography.xml#Hamle1">Hamlet</title> says.<lb/>
               I hope that you have celebrated Christmas &amp; the New<lb/>
               Year as happily as you expected and that your child-niece<lb/>
               has been transplanted from out of your fostering<lb/>
               shelter, into her new situation so gently &amp; happily<lb/>

               which has been reprinted at <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#Liverpool_ENK">Liverpool</placeName>, about<lb/>

               &amp; energetic Effort are certainly very sublime<lb/>

               but still I think that Calmness, Rest &amp; Regularity,<lb/>
               &amp; what Imogene calls "one's journal course"<lb/>
               are never to be underrated with impunity - at least<lb/>

               It would be <del>hopeless</del> endless to enter by letter<lb/>
               on the great question of the Pure Reason versus<lb/>

               But I can't resist scribbling a little off the edge<lb/>
               of it, as it were - If all knowledge be <choice>

               of all the rest - Hence I must be more sure of<lb/>
               the existence of this bit of paper than of the existence<lb/>
               of God. Again how can we derive from the senses<lb/>
               the accuracy, &amp; the eternal necessity of Mathematical<lb/>

## What does this Pull Request do?

Share why you are opening a PR and what is new in your PR. Did you add new records? Did you change an existing record? If so, why?

## How should this be tested?

If you changed an existing file or files, ask yourself:
- Do the changes alter the meaning of the encoding? Or are they inaccurately representing the digitized letter?
- Does this follow the project's encoding guidelines - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mrmfs6BHDj7DB9iRCd6B_hw03n2srZ4y/edit ?

For any commits to an XML file (newly created or not):
- Does the XML validate in Oxygen?

## Additional Notes

List any additional information the reviewer should have to successfully test the changes made. This could include information you are uncertain about etc.

                [LibNote]30[/LibNote]
                Bowood Tuesday Sep[superscript]r[/superscript].
                8th. - we arrived here yes-
                terday to dinner &amp; were
                most cordially received
                - no one here but M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Dumont
                - a young French [underline]judge[/underline] -
                and Sir George Paul - gone
                both this morning - no
                company expected for
                some days -
                Your letter to Honora of
                the 3[superscript]d[/superscript]. Sep reached us just
                as we were getting into
                the carriage to come here
                - But yours &amp; Lovells which
                you mention as having
                sent by M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Lees's frank
                has not yet reached us
                - and most anxious we
                are to receive it - The mo
                ment I receive it I will
                write
                
                <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_Bodleian_696_1818-09-08_page02.jpg"/>
                I now merely write this
                time in utmost haste to
                say we are at last where
                you, kindest of friends,
                have so much wished us
                to be - Honora is well &amp;
                tho thin looked extremely
                pretty &amp; nice yesterday at
                dinner - Miss Wilkinson
                &amp; Miss Briscoe have done
                all you could have wished
                for her - Lady Lansdowne
                is very kind in her man-
                ner towards her - I think
                Lady L just the same per
                -son - only fatter &amp; more
                formed in manner.
                This place as far as I can
                judge not naturally hand
                some - the house magnifi
                cent - Our rooms opening
                one into another just what

                [LibNote]31[/LibNote]
                you would wish for us -
                George lodged near us -
                He is well &amp; I believe happy
                - and desires poor Molly
                sh[superscript]d[/superscript]. be told he is well.
                I send this note through
                M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Ward - and send many
                letters as the shortest me-
                thod of communicating
                many things to you which
                I literally have not time
                to copy -
                I have just written to my
                Aunt R. the first letter
                since one from Bangor,
                - I have copied [underline]for[/underline] her from
                Dumonts letter all that
                relates to the M[superscript]s[/superscript]. -
                I long to rest my mind by
                going to my [underline]work[/underline] again -
                What a contrast between
                all [deletion]the [unclear][/unclear][/deletion] round us
                at this moment and all at

                home -!
                I [underline]endeavor[/underline] dear mother to hope
                that this sleep so sound &amp;
                often repeated will restore
                him - But a secret feeling
                at the bottom of my mind
                arising I believe from Cramp
                ton's predictions &amp; [underline]his[/underline] likeness
                to Henry make me tremble -
                I agree with you that if
                he does not recover it will
                be better to place him in Eng-
                land than any where in
                land than anywhere in
                Ireland - the worst place in
                the world for the reasons
                you mention would be
                M[superscript]r[/superscript]. Fox's -

                Grenville are to be here
                tomorrow.
                I must answer that I cannot
                recommend a governess -
                for I dont know of a good
                one - [underline]do you?[/underline] - [underline]answer[/underline] this

                       SundayFeb.y 8th 1818
                       Miss Baillie’s letter will not 
                       be quite intelligible to you 
                       my dear Aunt without a 
                       note from ME.—You must 
                       know that just after you 
                       left Dublin there appeared 
                       in some Dublin paper a let-
                       ter taken from a Scotch paper
                       called the Craftsman con-
                       taining a sort of critique 
                       or comparision between the 
                       novels of miss E and of the 
                       author of Waverley &amp;c—I [deletion]was[/deletion] 
                       believing as I always have 
                       done that Walter Scott if 
                       not the sole author at

                       least the directing soul of those 
                       works, and being really 
                       fond of him &amp; grateful for 
                       his kindness to me was 
                       particularly vexed to see
                       this insidious compari
                       son instituted between us
                       for in the course of the  de-
                       fence of miss E which this 
                       purported to be many things 
                       were said about him in 
                       which I should be very sorry
                       he could think that under
                       hand or any way I had 
                       any concern—I wrote to 
                       my friend Joanna express-
                       ing these feelings—

                       Now the first part of her 
                       letter will be intelligence 
                       but you will come to a story 
                       about Sir Alexr Gordon whh
                       requires an explanatory 
                       preface— 
                       All Dublin you know was talk
                       ing over the long canvassed 
                       question Is W. Scott or not the 
                       author of the 3 unclaimed 
                       novels?— Now one of the Miss 
                       Hamilton’s told Harriet B
                       who told me the following
                       anecdote.
                       That Sir Alex Gordon had 
                       declared to her his conviction 
                       of W. Scott being the author 
                       because before the publica
                       tion of Guy Mannering he 
                       the said Sir Alexr went
                       
                       <pb n="4" facs="Edgeworth_Bodleian_717_1818-02-08_page04.jpg"/>
                       to one of his tenants houses 
                       where he met W. Scott &amp; where 
                       first such a scene passed as is 
                       painted in Guy Mannering 
                       at the funeral of [unclear]Steeney[/unclear]— 
                       The said Sir Alexr further
                       declared that when he again
                       met Walter Scott after the pub
                       lication of Guy Mannering 
                       &amp; reminded him or was 
                       going to remind him of 
                       this circumstance Walter
                       Scott put his finger on his 
                       lips in token of silence 
                       &amp; secrecy— 
                       It appears you will see 
                       that the knight would 
                       have done better to be silent
                       Ys affectionately 
                       Maria Edgeworth

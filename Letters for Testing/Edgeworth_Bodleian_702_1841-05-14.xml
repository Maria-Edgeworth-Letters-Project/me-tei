                No longer --------------------------
                ----- Riegate - ten oclock clock
                Friday night May 14[superscript]h 1841
                My dear mother -- Fanny is
                here safe and sound and com
                fortably in bed in a very good
                [unclear] - and her head as low
                as she likes -- All right -- and
                she has had tea &amp; eaten bread
                &amp; butter &amp; a bit of dry[underline] toast nicely
                buttered by no hands as you
                may guess but those of Blac[unclear][/unclear]ly-
                -black &amp; Kindly -- friend - To be
                sure Lestock is the fondest &amp;
                most tender of husbands &amp; con-
                [insertion]gentle to her[underline][/underline]
                stantly [insertion]gentle gentle to [underline]her[/underline][/insertion] - But that is not what
                I was going to say - or you
                wanting to know [insertion](You impatient people 
                I see and I hear you!)
                </p>
                <p>
                Fanny is not nearly as
                much tired as I feared and
                I am sure as you feared she
                would be --- Perhaps however
                the bruise of tiredness may not
                appear immediately &amp; I must
                wait till I see how she is in
                the morning -- However you
                
                may as well have the pleasure
                of this good report while it
                is fresh &amp; true - </p>
                
                <p>
                We left London about five &amp;
                twenty minutes before six
                and were here a quarter
                before 9 - three and twenty
                miles- - not quite half way
                to Brighton - seven and twenty
                miles further to Brighton
                [deletion][unclear]TSoc [deletion][/deletion] So we cannot yet look
                back on the hardest part &amp;
                laugh - But we did smile
                often on the way hither, for
                it was a very good smooth
                road - one long hill to go
                down excepted she did not
                feel any inconvenience but
                the downhill motion pains </p>
                
                <p>
                - The evening was delightful
                and all the air perfumed
                (too much for her taste) with
                hawthorn and lilacs &amp;
                laburnams &amp; Judas trees in
                such full flower &amp; horse ches
                nuts in such full candalabra
                beauty - as she lay in the
                
                carriage she could see some
                of these [deletion]and[/deletion] her dear cheerful
                ready to be pleased temper
                is charming! - </p>
                
               <p>
                Lestock had contrived her
                diagonal couch so that
                she lay almost at full length
                her legs just humoring the
                thing.

                I am sorry to have made Lestock
                such a dumpy man -
                - But you may comprehend
                by these Scribbloglyphics of [unclear][/unclear]
                how we sat- tho not what like we were -
                Tell Dr Francis that the case wh[superscript]h[/superscript]
                he had made for my writing

                my seat standing on end &amp; put
                in a green-baize-bag &amp; with
                a horse hair cushion [insertion]at tuppence [/insertion]for me
                to sit upon- Oh! exactly the
                thing! [deletion]&amp;[/deletion] I had it made the day
                before by a charming man I went &amp;
                [unclear]beseeched[/unclear] to and [underline]prayed[/underline] to about it in
                Oxford S[superscript]t[/superscript] - Honora directed me to
                him and he is [underline]impayable[/underline] but I paid him - &amp; only 3/6

                It was thought impossible that
                I could be squeezed into the
                carriage and so it would,
                have been, [underline]but [/underline]for this device

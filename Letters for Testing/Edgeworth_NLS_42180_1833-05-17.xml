               little drawings - they are done by<lb/>

               for young readers last Christmas -<lb/>
               If you think that it would add to the<lb/>
               interest of the story to know that it<lb/>
               is founded on fact - <del>that it is so <unclear>far</unclear></del><lb/>
               so far that a woman &amp; her children<lb/>
               were actually buried &amp; half famished<lb/>
               under the snow, I would certify<lb/>
               the fact for you in a preface to your<lb/>
               young readers next Christmas if<lb/>
               you would have the portrait of the<lb/>
               poor woman engraved for a <choice><orig>frontis<lb/>
                  piece</orig><reg>frontispiece</reg></choice> -<lb/>
               The other drawing - <hi rend= "underline">the chimney</hi><lb/>
               <hi rend= "underline">sweeper and the owl</hi> - this was taken<lb/>
               from the life a few days ago - And it<lb/>
               has just occurred to me that I could<lb/>
               work the incident to which it refers<lb/>
               into a continuation <add>or second volume</add> of the History of poor Bob<lb/>
               <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_NLS_42180_1833_05_17_page02.jpg"/>
               the chimney sweeper which you thought<lb/>
               it worthwhile to reprint - I think I could<lb/>
               furnish about <del>40 or</del> <add>or <unclear>8</unclear>0</add> pages so as to<lb/>
               make <add>Poor</add> Bob whom I wish to raise by<lb/>
               his own exertions into Happy Bob<lb/>
               a fit companion for the Snow woman<lb/>
               <hi rend= "underline">as to length</hi> -<lb/>
               I would <hi rend= "underline">give</hi> you the end of the story<lb/>
               if you would have M<hi rend= "superscript"></hi>rs E's little <del>sketches</del><lb/>
               drawings well engraved for <del>frontis</del><lb/>
               <del>piece</del> the story- I know engravings<lb/>
               by good hands are very expensive &amp;<lb/>
               I am not sure that you would find<lb/>
               it worth your while to have these <hi rend= "underline">well</hi><lb/>
               <hi rend= "underline">engraved</hi> and I must distinctly say<lb/>
               that I would rather not have them<lb/>
               done at all than done by any inferior<lb/>
               hand- They must be by some of the<lb/>
               hands employed in Sir Walter Scotts<lb/>
               Waverly novels or his poetical works<lb/>
               Tell me frankly whether it be<lb/>
               worth your while to accept of my condi<lb/>
               tions - Of course I would wish to have<lb/>
               a few copies of the engravings for my<lb/>
               self and my friends - but for the number<lb/>
               <pb n="3" facs="Edgeworth_NLS_42180_1833_05_17_page03.jpg"/>
               I make no bargaining I should leave<lb/>
               that entirely to your own liberality<lb/>
               - my object is plainly to have the drawings<lb/>
               well engraved<lb/>
               Answer me without delay<lb/>
               - because if you should not like to accept<lb/>
               My conditions I would turn my<lb/>
               story another way &amp; not make it a<lb/>
               Continuation or Sequel of Poor Bob -<lb/>
               And if you do accept I should sit down<lb/>
               &amp; write Happy Bob directly - before the ideas<lb/>
               go out of my head<lb/>
               I beg at all events that you<lb/>
               will take care of the drawings &amp; that<lb/>
               you will _ if they are to be engraved <hi rend= "underline">Ad</hi><lb/>
               <hi rend= "underline">vise</hi> that they should not be spoilt in the<lb/>
               engravers hands - And if you return<lb/>
               them to me immediately let them<lb/>
               be packed in the same <hi rend= "underline"> little case</hi><lb/>

               send your answer to this letter<lb/>

               Apprehension had I of her danger insomuch<lb/>
               had Ashburner assured me she was going on well<lb/>
               (I remember his expression she may build Chateaux<lb/>
               on Espagne now -if she pleases)<lb/>
               that I accepted yesterday morning actually<lb/>
               yesterday morning an invitation which had <lb/>
               been a dozen times repeated [deletion]&amp; wished for[/deletion] by<lb/>
               M[superscript]r[/superscript] Rogers to go to one of his breakfasts [deletion]&amp; it was[/deletion]<lb/>
               a breakfast made on purpose for me with carte<lb/>
               blanche for my kith &amp; kin whom Rogers discovered<lb/>
               good natured man to be essential to my pleasure<lb/> </p>
            
            <p>
               Capt[superscript]n[/superscript] Beaufort, thinks of that too! wished to<lb/>
               go and asked me to introduce him &amp; Honora and<lb/>
               Rosa and Emily all dined much to [unclear][/unclear] so they<lb/>
               had invites special and Lestock but he c[superscript]d[/superscript] not<lb/> </p>
            <p>
               So we all went and saw his fine pictures<lb/>
               &amp; all his delightful things himself by far the<lb/>
               most delightful among them notwithstanding<lb/>
               all that nature did to forbid - If not the best<lb/>
               worth seeing Rogers is certainly one of the men best<lb/>
               worth hearing of modern conversation men<lb/></p>
            <p>
               Too [unclear]tender[/unclear] there was an admirable break<lb/>
               fast and we had it and him &amp; all of it to ourselves<lb/>
               the only thing I thought de trop was<lb/>
               one of the footmen - there were two in<lb/>
               waiting all Breakfast now one I<lb/>
               thought was [unclear][/unclear] de trop -<lb/>
               in former times 20 years or 10 years<lb/>
               ago one footman or man of some kind<lb/>
               at a private breakfast was enough for a [underline]marquess [/underline]or [underline]quis[/underline]<lb/></p>
            <p>
               But let this pass nobody complained of it - and I<lb/>
               enjoyed the full and complete satisfaction of seeing <lb/>
               all my kith and kin pleased - delighted - even<lb/>
               the fastidious captain his self -<lb/></p>
            <p>
               But only think how near pleasure &amp; pain - feast<lb/>
               ing &amp; revelry and all that happened that night<lb/>
               At parting with Rogers he holding both my hands<lb/>
               so pressed me to come back again &amp; breakfast once more all<lb/>
               [unclear][/unclear] - yes these young ones whom I find [unclear]are of[/unclear][unclear][/unclear]<lb/>

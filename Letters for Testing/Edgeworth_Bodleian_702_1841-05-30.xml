            <p>A welcome, more welcome
               more delightfully welcome
               to me could not have met
               my eyes than the note in
               your own dear handwriting </p>
               <p> I hope it did not give you
               horrid pain to write it?
               And so much! and so well
               written as if you had never
               been ill -- whatever it cost you
               believe me you have given
               me heartfelt pleasure and
               more than pleasure - satisfaction. </p>
               <p>Harriet Beaufort told you yes
               terday what Crampton says
               about the care you ought to take
               not to exert yourself or to do any
               thing that distresses you standing
               sitting -- or moving -- How angry
               he would have been had he
               four pages in your own hand. </p>
               <p>Dearest mother thank you
               thank you - I will not give you an
               opportunity of doing the like again
               for I will be with you soon & then
               you can only sin by talking or hearing too
               much </p>

               <p> I left London without any anxiety
               about Fanny as I had to the very
               last day and hour satisfactory
               accounts of her progressing - or
               or at least of her not back-sliding
               I enclose two [underline]billet doux[/underline] from her
               & of her for the pleasure of your
               eyes - </p>
               <p> I set off from London, from the
               Railroad station at 9 oclock - </p>
               <p>Kind Lestock having brought me
               bag & baggage and all to the right
               point at the right minute and
               there was Charles Fox ready for me
               having taken our two places in the
               Coupee - Only costs 2Sh a piece more
               than in the 1[superscript]s[/superscript] class other carriages &
               it is delightfully comfortable - as
               good as any gentleman's chariot
               is or need to be & as dear & large
               windows & green curtains & all that
               most luxurious [underline]exclusive[/underline] could want
               or wish for excluding sun into the bargain
               or not as you like - A most pleasant
               journey I had - the easiness of the
               motion on the rail way from Birming
               ham to Liverpool resting me complete
               ly after the roughness and great
               joggling of the rail-road from
               London to Birmingham - Francis
               may remember that I observed this
               difference when I travelled with
               him & now I have verified it. Tho

               we came all through in one day
               from London to Liv.[superscript]l[/superscript] I was not the
               least tired [insertion]arrived at 1/2 after 5 at Liverpool Liverpool[/insertion] - We had but just time
               to get from Liv[superscript]l[/superscript] Rail road station in
               fly to steam packet & by C Fox's manual
               exertions to get my 4 boxes & 1 bag
               & his own (including two rolls of window
               curtain chintz of his, so barba
               rously ill done up that they

               Sir William Betham & 2 other members of
               parl. (names forgotten) were on board
               the packet & gathered round Charles &
               me - and talked an immensity of politics
               [deletion]&c[/deletion] - Peel and Dissolution &c &c - Literature
               & compliments for me interspersed
               more than quantum suff - And I
               was glad at last even to get down to
               my close birth - with 2 quakers & their
               bonnets and a [unclear]lady [/unclear] contrast [insertion]in colors[/insertion] - all very quiet
               and all fell fast asleep - And nobody
               stirred till morning 6 oclock & a very
               fine morning and as calm a night
               as would be - [deletion][/deletion] a ten & half hours
               passage -
               C Fox brought me to this nice house
               and dear Harriet ready dressed at
               the door by 1/4 before 8 - and she
               welcomed me with her own smiles
               and your note - I had had coffee before
               I quitted Steampacket - So no hurry for
               breakfast & took Harriets advice & lay
               down for half an hour & then washed
               & refreshed & no more tired than if I had

                    Sneyd and Emma returned home<lb/>
                    on tuesday - but Lord &amp; Lady Stafford<lb/>
                    expressed such an earnest wish that<lb/>
                    we should stay a little longer that<lb/>

                    nor could any ear mistake the<lb/>
                    sound of the clapping of her hands<lb/>
                    - She is so kind to Honora and<lb/>
                    Fanny &amp; seems to value them<lb/>
                    so justly &amp; so to enjoy their compa<lb/>

                    on any farther let me put your mind<lb/>
                    at ease dearest mother about Fanny's<lb/>
                    health - Her cold is going off - her<lb/>
                    own looks are coming on - The pink<lb/>
                    shell color is gaining &amp; spreading over<lb/>
                    the turnip cheek - &amp; the pleased and<lb/>
                    pleasing expression is lighting in those<lb/>
                    of which Admiral Pakenham said -<lb/>
                    nothing but the truth - She has<lb/>
                    ridden out these last two mornings<lb/>
                    on a nice pon[insertion]e[/insertion]y with Lady Elizabeth<lb/>
                    - the rest of the morning she has past<lb/>
                    in trying to take a likeness of Lady<lb/>
                    Elizabeth - She &amp; I sit up in Lady E's<lb/>
                    comfortable little room (about the<lb/>
                    size of your cabinet but very light) -<lb/>
                    and I talk while Fanny draws &amp;<lb/>
                    we are all delightfully happy &amp;<lb/>
                    agreeable of course - Honora mean<lb/>

                    water colors under Lady Stafford's eye<lb/>

                    a drawing on purpose to shew her<lb/>

                    perfectly free from all vanity or<lb/>
                    care about them &amp; from all affecta-<lb/>
                    tion of humility - I would not for<lb/>
                    any consideration have missed<lb/>
                    this near &amp; intimate view of her<lb/>
                    character &amp; domestic habits - What<lb/>

                    into both head &amp; heart that dear<lb/>

                    - It is impossible to tell you <hi rend="underline">how</hi> kind<lb/>
                    Lady Stafford has been to us - And<lb/>
                    you would be still more satisfied<lb/>
                    - as I am - on Honora &amp; Fanny's ac-<lb/>

                    see how <hi rend="underline">they</hi> are treated - not as<lb/>
                    appendages to an authoress - but<lb/>
                    as persons standing upon their<lb/>
                    own merits &amp; their own powers<lb/>
                    of pleasing in conversation and<lb/>
                    society - Lady Stafford has found<lb/>
                    many most gratifying occasions<lb/>
                    for expressing this - She has repeatedly<lb/>

                    Fanny she <hi rend="superscript">particularly</hi> likes<lb/>

                    sensible answers when one asks<lb/>
                    her any thing - She is a most pleasing<lb/>

                    <add>(disqualifying speech of mine)</add> - Oh more than that - She is certainly<lb/>

                    Lord Francis says more than<lb/>

                <p>
                    Lord Francis is very clever and original<lb/>

                    kind - solemn - or vain - as can be<lb/>
                    conceived - His drawings &amp; his poetry<lb/>
                    would both be excellent even if a<lb/>

                    have fallen too suddenly in love<lb/>
                    with all these people - But I assure<lb/>

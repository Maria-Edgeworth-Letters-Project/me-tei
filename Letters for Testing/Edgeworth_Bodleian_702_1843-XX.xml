               I find wages impracticable -<lb/>

               <p>- I must put all this as you<lb/>
               will say out of my head - &amp; so I will if<lb/>
               I can - But I do so long for your<lb/>

               about the <persName ref="./Personography.xml#OHigW1" cert="medium">Lord Bishop Higgins</persName> &amp;<lb/>
               the Pope &amp; the prayers of his Holiness<lb/>

               believed it he said unless it had<lb/>

               <p>It is very amusing to me to hear<lb/>

                     dical</orig><reg>radical</reg></choice> opinions all mixed up together<lb/>
               frying &amp; hissing <add>within him</add> &amp; boiling over sometimes<lb/>
               - He conceives that <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName> is still<lb/>
               a dreadfully persecuted country - treated<lb/>
               quite as a conquered country - shockingly<lb/>
               therefore he cannot but wish for the repeal<lb/>
               of the Union to set Ireland free at last<lb/>
               
               <pb n="2" facs="Edgeworth_Bodleian_702_1843-XX_page02.jpg"/>
                  - It is so horridly unjust he says that she <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#IE">Ireland</placeName><lb/>
                  should be <hi rend="underline">oppressed</hi> by the English debt<lb/>
                  But then I tell him <placeName ref="./Placeography.xml#ENK">England</placeName> does not<lb/>
                  tax us - and opens her markets to us<lb/>
                  &amp;c But still says he she is insulted<lb/>
                  as a conquered country has no parliament of<lb/>
                  her own - &amp; was taken from her by the Union<lb/></p>
            
            <p>There must be a repeal of that Union<lb/>
               stamping about on the hearth<lb/>
               (and the tear full in his eye about nothing)<lb/></p>
                  
            <p>- Then your Irish tenants are so<lb/>
               cruelly oppressed by your Irish landlord<lb/>
               There must be a redress of grievances<lb/>
               &amp; fixity of tenure<lb/>

               If you mean certainly that their<lb/>
               farms will be relet to them &amp; <unclear>input</unclear> allowed<lb/></p>
               
               <p>If you mean by fixity of tenure that<lb/>
               all the tenants sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> remain in fixed possession<lb/>
               of the landlords property the landlord<lb/>

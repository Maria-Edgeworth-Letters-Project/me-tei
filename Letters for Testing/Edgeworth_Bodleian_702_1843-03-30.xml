               the whole of its flight &
               descent - How much plea
               sure you gave dearest mo-
               ther you can hardly know
               unless you could see & hear
               behind your back as well
               as before your face -
               I never was more delighted
               than by the surprise of
               seeing your dear rosy face
               lightening upon me and so
               affectionately & unexpectedly
               and I only wish I had that
               hug over again -
               We all, - meaning Harriet
               & myself

               I hope dearest mother
               that the pleasure you have
               given & received I trust
               on this little occasion will
               encourage you to indulge

               I am so glad that
               you had the luck at
               the last moment to
               catch the unpacking
               of the picture of Walter
               though between you &
               I it is but a sorry drawing
               and does not suit (in my
               opinion the place where it
               now is viz over the Bishop
               of Meaths admirable head
               and between you & Francis

               room - It does not match any
               thing in this room - & I cant
               abide it - But it was very good
               of Aunt Henrietta to get it done
               and to send it to Mary Anne & C
               A new music has just ar-
               rived & the room is all ears
               And Lucy is judging - and
               I am no judge but very
               affectionately yours
               ME
               I am so glad you have
               Conde - Do you see in
               todays paper the report that
               Lord Mahon is to go Embassa
               dor to Spain - I hope it is
               done - it would suit &
               gratify him so much
               Thank you for mentioning
               Marys delight on her sealed

                    My dearest mother - your most<lb/>
                    touching affectionate letter<lb/>

                    (a quarter before 4 oclock')<lb/>
                    read to me - Conceive that from<lb/>
                    the moment it was put into her<lb/>
                    hands at 12 oclock when she<lb/>
                    was dressing till this very instant<lb/>
                    she never had one interval<lb/>
                    to ourselves when she could<lb/>
                    impart it to me - Such streams<lb/>

                    a life! ! [underline]could[/underline] not at my age &amp;<lb/>
                    such as I am for long -- I never<lb/>

                    being admitted which cannot<lb/>
                    be resisted- -- Old Lady Charleville<lb/>

                    unnecessarily painful - and<lb/>
                    here with Fanny I felt that I<lb/>
                    could be of some pleasure if not<lb/>
                    some use to this beloved child<lb/>
                    of yours When it was impossi<lb/>

                    But now when all is over<lb/>
                    &amp; you have done all for that<lb/>
                    gentle spirit that could be done<lb/>
                    do you not feel Dear Mother<lb/>
                    that Fanny must be your<lb/>
                    next object.? - It has occurred<lb/>
                    to me that you might possibly<lb/>
                    think of coming over with Hono<lb/>
                    ra immediately - If this could<lb/>
                    be do not let anything I have<lb/>

                    To Harriet Butler<lb/>
                    My dear Harriet - Will you be<lb/>
                    so kind to look in the Imperial<lb/>
                    under my bed for two black<lb/>

                    you will find - and in the<lb/>
                    box where you found Lady EW's<lb/>
                    candlestick some black buckle<lb/>
                    &amp;c - If Honora can bring them<lb/>
                    over I should be obliged to her<lb/>
                    - But do not ask her, if you see<lb/>
                    that it would be a plague to<lb/>
                    her - I have bought what is imme<lb/>
                    
                    
                    diately necessary - so that<lb/>

                    know what I am writing - teeth! teeth! teeth!<lb/>
                    the first and last plagues of life in first and<lb/>
                    second childhood - I hope that my own dear<lb/>
                    little Maria the pretty is no more tormented with<lb/>
                    the cutting &amp; coming of her pearly white teeth -<lb/>
                    How different this baby from her! - But I will not<lb/>

                    baby is ours - and dear Lucy, I am glad that<lb/>
                    you have in your arms as I trust you have at<lb/>
                    this moment fondly playing with you and<lb/>
                    being the comfort of your life - through all -<lb/>
                    And I hereby promise you that I will not be jealous<lb/>
                    of you nor even angry with [insertion]the[/insertion] darling if she should<lb/>
                    not know me when [underline]first[/underline] I come back - &amp; [insertion]it[/insertion] should<lb/>

                    I have made a bold promise - Heaven send I may be<lb/>
                    as good as my word -<lb/>
                    We were not any in this house good enough to go to church<lb/>
                    to day - because the child was so bad - But<lb/>
                    I see a whole regiment of young men and boys from<lb/>
                    14 to 20 - who with a full band of music playing<lb/>

                    till they get within sight &amp; decent distance of the<lb/>

                    This reg[superscript]t[/superscript]. of youths are the pupils who are being<lb/>
